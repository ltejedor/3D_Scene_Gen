      "content": "I\u2019ll never forget that moment when the judge asked, \u201cDid he hit you?\u201d I was standing in the courtroom, our 4-month old son sleeping in the baby carrier strapped to my chest. I didn\u2019t know what to say. Everything else \u2013 the years of insults, the screaming in my face, the violence, the gaslighting, the drug abuse \u2013 was being overlooked. Just because you\u2019ve never been hit, doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t being abused.\n\nMy ex-husband had a very violent temper, and I was constantly trying to make him happy to avoid the next outburst. If he was upset, it was not uncommon for him to put a hole in our wall, throw things, or break items that meant something to me.\n\nDuring one of the fights in our first apartment, he knocked over shelves and threw everything on my dresser onto the floor. It was so loud, and glass shattered everywhere. We were very friendly with our upstairs neighbors at the time. Instead of being concerned about my safety, I was worried about what they were going to think. I loved him so much. I wanted to protect him. I thought it was my job to keep the peace as his wife. I didn\u2019t want anyone to think badly of him, so I hid as much as I could.\n\nI covered up, and he reinforced it was always my fault. \u201cLook what you made me do,\u201d he would say to me, still so angry.\n\nI have only recently been able to talk about the forced intimacy in our marriage; what I now know is appropriately referred to as marital rape. I didn\u2019t think it was possible, but so many times I didn\u2019t want to; and he knew that. But he pressured me into \u201cfulfilling my duty as his wife.\u201d I would just lay there and cried until he was done. I didn\u2019t know what else to do.\n\nOne fight that stands out in my memory was when I was eight months pregnant with our second child. I knew something was off because his volatile temper was escalating even faster than usual. I jokingly said, \u201cwhat is wrong with you \u2013 do you need to go to rehab or something?\u201d I thought the comparison would make him realize how crazy he was acting. Only, he was abusing drugs. He raised his right hand high behind his head and started to swing it down to hit me. I said, \u201cGo ahead, hit me. Do something that leaves a mark.\u201d That was when the hand stopped. I could feel the anger rippling off of him. His face resembled an angry ape. His eyes were large and his breathing was heavy. After a moment of staring me down, he stormed off.\n\nHe first entered rehab when my youngest was 8-weeks old and my oldest was about to turn four. They were so young.\n\nHe relapsed his very first day out of rehab, and immediately entered another rehab. He called me his first night there and yelled at me about how this was all my fault. He wanted to know what I was going to do to fix this. When I didn\u2019t do what he wanted, he removed me from the list of people the rehab could talk to. That was when I realized we weren\u2019t safe. He would continue to threaten me and the boys, and I sought a temporary restraining order.\n\nThis was the moment that put me in front of the judge. The judge who asked if I had ever been hit. No\u2026I had stopped him. But that wasn\u2019t the whole story. What about everything else?\n\nI thought this would end the manipulation, the lies, the abuse. But it continued through court. Our divorce took forever because he was rehabbing and relapsing. He wouldn\u2019t show up to our court appointments. When he did, I was told I needed to find forgiveness and find a way to heal the family. It was still my responsibility.\n\nMeanwhile, I was doing everything alone - caring for the children, packing up his things and my things so that I could sell the family house. He didn't contribute anything to support the kids or for the house, arguing that he couldn\u2019t. Even when the court ruled that I wasn\u2019t responsible for his bills, he would take money from our joint bank account. The bank gave me such a hard time closing the account to get the theft to stop. It was impossibly stressful.\n\nI really thank God for the friends, coworkers and family who supported me through it all. After the divorce I got remarried, but my ex just kept trying to get custody and then failing to show up because of his drug addiction. And still, I was told it was my job to build trust and figure out how to heal the family.\n\nHe died from an overdose two years ago. With everything I\u2019ve just shared, his death still tears me apart inside. There was always a part of me that hoped he would find recovery and come back to the kids. I took an incessant amount of videos and photos of the boys to share with him so that he could see what he missed when the man I loved finally came back. But that never happened. There are still times I feel guilty about choosing the children and choosing myself. I worry that I made the wrong decision \u2013 that if I had stayed with him, I could have made him better.\n\nThat\u2019s always the question people have about victims of domestic violence \u2013 \u201cwhy don\u2019t they just leave?\u201d I totally get why they don\u2019t leave. I didn\u2019t leave because of the abuse. I ultimately left because of the drugs. He could have hit me that day when I was pregnant, and I would have stayed. I would\u2019ve put him first.\n\nAmidst all of this, there were so many wonderful things about him. He was a goofball. He loved baseball. He loved children. I still remember him playing with our oldest \u2013 they would meet in their imaginations and play the best games. I remember when I was teaching at night. I would come home, and he\u2019d be ready with an ice cream sundae, telling me to put my feet up. All these moments existed in the same relationship. That\u2019s why I stayed for as long as I did.\n\nSo, no, judge, he didn\u2019t hit me. But how about listening to my whole story?",

They had children together, shared a life together, depended on each other financially. It wasn\u2019t easy to break things off.\n\nAt first, Natalie felt like she was spiraling downwards. She was grieving, questioning her decision to leave, worrying about the impact on her kids, who seemed unnaturally quiet, almost numb to their new surroundings. Had she made the right choice?\n\nBut when her case manager helped Natalie to secure medical insurance, and she and her two children were able to access the care of a doctor again, it felt like the beginning of a new day. Things were starting to come together, and she could do this.\n\nNatalie began thinking about their next steps. She didn\u2019t want to take the kids to another shelter or housing program, but she didn\u2019t know where else to go. Her case manager asked about family members who might be willing to help, but Natalie was weary of their judgmental questions and accusations.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until she reached out to her cousin that she felt her next steps begin to solidify. She trembled as she dialed, embarrassed to admit the realities of the abuse to her cousin. But instead of another \u201cI told you so,\u201d she was instead welcomed to a new home.\n\n\u201cYou just come down here and stay with us. The kids can go to school here. We\u2019ve got room.\u201d\n\nAnd with that unexpected invitation, a whole new future opened up. Within a single day, the case management team at Women Against Abuse had booked train tickets for Natalie and her children, helped them pack their essentials, and arranged the rest of preparations needed to carry them to their new life.\n\nThe speed with which it all came together was shocking, but Natalie never looked back. She was thrilled for this opportunity to start fresh, to build a safe and secure new life for herself and her children.",

It was out of the blue. Once he started it never stopped. The beatings were so intense. I knew that my life was at stake. There was times I would wake up. There was times that I thought I would never wake up. They were happening in public behind closed doors and it's 7-11 to a black tie affair anyway, which has happened. Somehow I found myself at a woman's against abuse shelter. At the time this kind of haven was revolutionary. It was just, it was unheard of. The start of women against abuse was aligned with the beginning of the movement where women took a stand and said this needs to stop and there needs to be an option. I mean, we were back in the 70's when divorce wasn't prevalent and it was really hard to leave a marriage. When you go to a shelter, it's almost like going home. You're walking into a place that you know you can take a deep breath. You're not alone. You don't feel like the outcast. You don't feel like the freak. No one ever tells you to leave. What do you want to do? We're here to help you and it's just boom boom boom boom boom and they're there time and again. The first of many final straws was a series of beatings and rapes, backseat of cars, dirt in my face on the ground, face down on the ground, and waking up on the floor four days later. I knew that I had to leave and I was willing to travel cross-country things in my life. It was boomtown. Within three or four days I had two dozen job offers. The cycle of abuse is so difficult. I let her from home. I accepted call back. That same night, the nightmare started all over again. I knew that I was walking into war zone, frontline. So I slept with a gun underneath the pillow to my temple. Fingered on the trigger for a couple of minutes. And I just said, OK, time to change. This is crazy. This is crazy. This is over the top. And that's when I knew I'm out. I'm done. And here I am. The one thing about going to a shelter was you immediately feel as though it's not just you. That makes you feel better.

You would go in, you got a hot meal, you would go to sleep and the next day you know you're going to go meet with someone and say, alright, where are you at, what can we do, how can we help, you need a job, you need benefits, you need whatever, and there it's like this army just marches in to help you get there. We've seen the need for our safety services really grow where we turn away thousands and thousands of people who need safe shelter each year. Our police force responds to over a hundred thousand domestic violence incidents per year and our shelter can only accommodate a small number of the people who need it. In Philadelphia we have less beds than other cities our size for domestic violence victims who are fleeing violence. Without Women Against Abuse I shudder to think where I would be. I can't even begin to imagine what my life would be, where I would be. I wouldn't be sitting here the person I am today. But I've never asked myself that question. Thank God I never had to.",

      "content": "In the early stages of my mother's new relationship, she earned a promotion at work. Me and my little brother were sent to a babysitter who lived in our building. The babysitter\u2019s 18-year-old son molested me every day. My mom found out, and asked her boyfriend to move in with us out of fear. I was gung-ho about it. It was nice to have a man at home again because I missed my dad and the added security. And he was such a loveable guy, at first.\n\nMy mother had always exuded strength and beauty. She\u2019s not a large woman, but when she walked into the room, people took notice. She was a queen. My Queen!\n\nBut her boyfriend\u2019s attitude towards her changed swiftly. When my mom lost her job, she and her boyfriend opened a speakeasy. The liquor bottles started piling up, and strangers frequented our house. Some of my relatives tried to intervene, and my mom decided to pull the plug on the new business. But when she tried to put an end to it, her boyfriend beat her black and blue.\n\nI remember my mother\u2019s face looking as if she had been run over by a train. As she sat on the couch in tears, she was saying \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t okay. I felt like it was all my fault. Had I never got molested, had we never had to go to court, had I never been born, she would have been okay. At least that\u2019s what I believed back then.\n\nThe abuse went on like this for years. They would argue. He would hurt her, and I\u2019d feel sick to my stomach as I watched my mom take him back. I saw less and less of the woman my mother had been.\n\nMy brothers and I grew increasingly angry. The last straw was when he shot up our refrigerator. He put three bullets in it with my mom standing right there in the kitchen.\n\nUpon the arrival of the police, we were promptly relocated. Due to space constraints at our family's residence, we sought refuge at the Women Against Abuse (WAA) emergency shelter. Leaving our previous life behind was difficult, but WAA provided unwavering support throughout the transition. We received fresh clothing and enjoyed regular family-style meals. Sharing a room with my mother and brothers was a unique experience, but our sense of safety made it worthwhile.\n\nMost of all, I fell in love with the workers there who would care for me, encourage me, hold my hand, or give me a hug when I needed it.\n\nI missed months of second grade as my mom tried to figure out our next steps. I had been in the mentally gifted program, so WAA staff made sure I kept up with my studies. They also helped connect me with dance classes, the community\u2019s church choir, and family talent shows. Spaghetti nights were always the best!\n\nMy time at the shelter was not entirely a blissful experience. It was also a period of great emotional turmoil. My mother, brothers and I were still struggling to cope with the trauma we had endured, and I began experiencing troubling symptoms. Bedwetting and recurring nightmares became a reality that I couldn't seem to control. Furthermore, my mother's relationship with her abusive partner took an unexpected turn. Their phone calls became more frequent, and she even started visiting him.\n\nEventually, we had to say goodbye to the WAA shelter, and it was one of the hardest goodbyes I ever had to make because I knew we were safe there. I was walking back into a world that was so unsafe for me and my brothers.\n\nMy mom\u2019s ex moved right back in with us, and the cycle started all over again. And this time there was no support or WAA shelter. Our family was frustrated that my mom couldn\u2019t see how toxic this relationship was and they started pulling away.\n\nThe abuse didn\u2019t happen every day, but it felt like every day because you never knew what to expect. Would today be the day you arrived home from school to see your mom with a black eye and the house all messed up? Or would we find my mother dead? Even worse, was I next?\n\nInstead of him getting help or a job, he moved his kids in, so we were now a seven-person household living in a two-bedroom apartment. There was nowhere to hide. You\u2019d hear the fights and arguments and beatings, and my older brother would try to run in and fight and save my mother, but he couldn\u2019t save her. He\u2019d just get beaten too.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was 11 and suffered a gang rape on the way to school that my life finally changed. I walked home from the park where I had been raped to find the police arresting my mom\u2019s abusive partner. They had him in handcuffs, and \u2013 despite feeling broken and lifeless from what had just happened to me \u2013 I smiled. For the first time since he walked into our lives, she was choosing herself, and it felt like she was choosing me too.\n\nWhen I was about 14 or 15, my mom met \u201cher person\u201d and has been married to him for 30 years because she finally took the time to love herself. That is my message \u2013 you must love yourself.\n\nIt took me 20 years to fully forgive my mother for all she exposed my brothers and me to. But what won\u2019t kill you will certainly make you stronger, and I am a force to be reckoned with!\n\nToday I have four beautiful children. My oldest daughter is engaged to a wonderful young man. I broke the cycle for my kids. They know we have a zero-tolerance policy for abuse. I never wanted to be married or live with a man after all I had experienced, but that is finally starting to change. I\u2019m not afraid anymore. I want those things now.\n\nI also have a flourishing career, and I'm leading the charge for change in my role within City Council.\n\nLooking back, I\u2019m so grateful for Women Against Abuse, because had I not had that organization in my life as a child, I can promise you that I would have been a different woman today. Those words and seeds that were planted in me by the women and men who worked there stayed within me and blossomed and grew.",

I never knew whether I\u2019d be dealing with crack cocaine, alcohol or pills when he walked in the door each night.\n\nOur friends and family didn\u2019t know about the abuse, or his constant need to control me. Rodney said he\u2019d get fired if I pressed charges for the bruises and injuries, and we needed the insurance that came with his job.\n\nLiving with him, I felt like a prisoner.\n\nAfter years of dealing with the abuse that no one knew about, the truth of our relationship became public on the day of my son\u2019s high school graduation. As usual, Rodney was high and drunk. But, despite that, it was a proud day for me as I watched my son walk across the stage to receive his diploma. Later, back at home, I was busy sending pictures to my family. Rodney always grew aggravated when I texted in front of him, but I wasn\u2019t paying him any mind, because I had decided that this day was about my son and not him.\n\nNext thing I knew, he punched me in the face.\n\nWith my head spinning, I called my other adult son to pick me up and help me file for a Protection From Abuse order. I was putting ice on my face when I heard our neighbors shouting. My son and Rodney were fighting in the street!\n\nRodney had ended up face down on the street, and claimed I was to blame. He told the Police I was crazy \u2013 that I had mental health problems. I was scared, angry and humiliated all at the same time.\n\nRodney was always able to manipulate the facts, even talking his way around my 9-1-1 call. The Police took his word over mine. They didn\u2019t see the bedroom door he had kicked in during his rampage to hurt me.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe what was happening \u2013 I was arrested and taken to jail! When I was released two days later, Rodney threatened to press charges against my son if I didn\u2019t go back to him. I couldn\u2019t let him ruin my son\u2019s chances at a full and happy life. I would go back and make the best of things for a year. I told him he had a year to get clean. But that never happened.\n\nIn fact, Rodney\u2019s addictions and abusive behavior grew, spilling beyond our home and into our local hospital, where I was having surgery. Rodney would visit me after work, stinking of alcohol. I remember the troubled looks on the nurses\u2019 faces when he would station himself, feet on my bed, for hours on end, sleeping off his hangover. He grew agitated and was asked to leave. He stalked me with nonstop calls and texts. My doctor saw what was happening and refused to release me to him. She said \u201cShe\u2019s not going home, just to end up back here.\u201d\n\nThey kept me for a couple of extra days as I looked for a safe place to go \u2013 I needed care as I healed, and ultimately I took a taxi home, where my son nursed me back to health.\n\nThings reached a breaking point when, during an argument, I told Rodney he couldn\u2019t use my car. It was really my son\u2019s car & Rodney hated the fact that I had access to my own transportation \u2013 that I could go out whenever I wanted to. So, he would insist on going everywhere with me \u2013 to the market, the pharmacy, the hairdressers. He would never let me drive \u2013 even if he was drunk. It was less stressful to just stay home. I became more and more isolated \u2013 shut off from family, church friends and neighbors. Folks would say that they always saw him, but never his partner. He lied about me, told them I was crazy & ruined my reputation.\n\nOnly my next door neighbor was wise to our situation. She and I had a system in place. She would call 9-1-1 if she heard me knock on the wall between our houses.\n\nFor years, I tried to make it work until I was just too tired \u2013 tired physically and emotionally, and tired of being afraid.\n\nWhen I decided to break things off, I called the Philadelphia Domestic Violence Hotline, but the shelter didn\u2019t have any beds available \u2013 they were full. Even though I had a restraining order against Rodney, I decided not to stay in our home \u2013 I couldn\u2019t live with the harassment that his family was aiming at me. My home had truly become a prison. So I borrowed money and moved into an apartment with my children to escape the abuse.\n\nThe apartment wasn\u2019t much, but when I left that house, I felt like I was free.\n\nToday, I am free \u2013 free from Rodney, free from the fear that haunted me every day that I spent with him, free from the shame of hiding this secret.\n\nI am a survivor of domestic violence & I share that with you to help others avoid a similar fate. For anyone out there who is suffering in silence, let me be that voice for you. Listen to me when I tell you, It is not your fault. There are resources available to help you break free and build a life of peace.\n\nThere is hope.\n\nMy story touches on so many systems \u2013 from hospitals, to work places, to law enforcement and courts, to behavioral health, to addiction treatment providers.\n\nIt was also heavily influenced by neighbors \u2013 people living next door to the abuse. If a coordinated community response like Shared Safety had been in place for me, I wouldn\u2019t have fallen through the cracks.\n\nMaybe if my childhood had been different \u2013 if I hadn\u2019t been abused as a child and sexually assaulted as a teen; if I\u2019d had a trusted person to confide in; or a safe place to go; Maybe if a teacher or a doctor or a neighbor or a supervisor had noticed something wasn\u2019t quite right and said something or done something.\n\nIf there had been even one caring and supportive voice \u2013 maybe then, I wouldn\u2019t have lived with the abuse for so long.\n\nI am a survivor of domestic violence & I share that with you to help others avoid a similar fate. For anyone out there who is suffering in silence, let me be that voice for you. Listen to me when I tell you, It is not your fault.

I thought I was in love, so I ignored the disapproval of my mom and sister.\n\nI became pregnant with my daughter with another man during our on and off dating, and this caused huge problems in our relationship.\n\nWe moved in together and the abusive situation became apparent to everyone but me. I was convinced that I was in love and happy; that we were a family. I felt forced to choose, and decided I didn't want my family in my life for the sake of my own \u201chappiness.\u201d\n\nThen the psychological abuse began. My abuser accused me of cheating and told me that no one else was going to love me as much as he did; that I would never be good enough for anyone else. I started to believe I was really worthless.

After enduring years of emotional and physical abuse, Bec made the courageous decision to reach out for support and leave the relationship for good.\n\n\u201c\n\nHe positioned himself in my life as someone who was going to save me, look after me. He made himself look like the epitome of the \u201cgood bloke\u201d that everybody talks about.\n\n\u201c\nI met my perpetrator in my early 20s, at a really vulnerable point in my life. The sudden death of my dad hit our family hard, and I was struggling to cope.\n\nOur relationship started quickly \u2013 and looking back, all the red flags were there. He was emotionally and psychologically abusive, but it was subtle. Harder to see. He was an expert at making me think I was making my own decisions. He convinced me to quit my job, to stop talking to my friends. He told me I had mental health issues and couldn\u2019t look after myself. He made me feel that all I needed was him. I was so isolated. I felt like I couldn\u2019t tell anybody.\n\nWhen I fell pregnant 6 months into the relationship, that\u2019s when the physical violence started. He hurt me so badly I miscarried. I was devastated. But every time I would leave, he would be so apologetic and loving, promising to change. I would always go back because I believed him. The mental scars from his control and abuse ran so deep.\n\nThere were several times he was so violent I ended up in hospital. Doctors didn\u2019t ask the question, and I was an expert at pretending everything was okay.\n\n \n\nHow my situation changed\n\nAfter around 5 years of being incredibly isolated, I went back to school. Having that time away from him, socialising and making new friends, I started to realise who I used to be. I wanted her back \u2013 I wanted to take control of my life again.\n\nThe violence escalated around this time because he knew he was losing control. A big turning point was when my nephew was born, and he tried to stop me from seeing him. I put my foot down and he physically assaulted me.\n\nMy final lightbulb moment was when he strangled me. I remember saying to myself, \u2018if you don\u2019t leave now, you will never leave\u2019. I knew I had to get out, or I would die.\n\nWhen I look back, I truly have no idea how I survived.\n\n \n\nRegaining my sense of self\n\nAfter he strangled me, I reached out to a specialist family violence service who supported me with an escape plan and a mobile phone. I had to wait two weeks for an intervention order so I slept in my car, moving it to a different location everyday so he wouldn\u2019t find me.\n\nThe violence and abuse didn\u2019t stop right away, even though I had left the relationship. Despite having an intervention order, he continued to stalk and harass me. It took a long time for me to feel safe again.\n\n \n\nWhat the experience taught me\n\nIt is never too late to leave. I always thought that everything was my fault, and nobody would believe me. I realise now that none of this was my fault, and nobody has a right to determine where my life goes.\n\nWhen you\u2019re in the midst of abuse, you feel empty and alone. You don\u2019t feel human. It can be hard to see, but there are places you can go for help. You are worth more than nothing, you\u2019re worth everything.",

On leaving the relationship, Donna slowly regained her confidence, undertook study at university and gained secure work.\n\n\u201c\n\nI learnt a lot of lessons the hardest possible way. If I had a friend who was going through a similar situation, this is what I would tell her.\n\n\u201c\nI met him when I was 16 years old and I was living in Hong Kong. He was older than me and lived in Australia. We began very slowly, just writing letters and talking to one another by phone. I came to Australia to study when I was 21 years old. That\u2019s when he asked me out. Because we had been communicating for years I thought I knew him but I didn\u2019t.  \n\nEarly on in our relationship things were good. We did the usual things, like catching a movie, and going to the beach. Because I was new to Australia, he showed me around and gave me lots of little gifts and flowers.\n\nBut, looking back, there were lots of early tell-tale signs. Once he got really upset and screamed at me for misunderstanding where we were to meet. His outburst scared me so much but he explained his reaction by telling me \u201cI love you so much, I worry about you so much. You\u2019re a stranger here and if anything happened to you I would not forgive myself.\u201d\n\nAnother time he threw an object at me. It cut my knee and I had to go to the emergency department. I told them that I\u2019d fallen off my bike. He made another excuse, telling me that he was stressed because of his work and apologised. I ended up returning to my family in Hong Kong. Then, after some time, he called me and declared he loved me so much that he couldn\u2019t live without me, and would I marry him.\n\nI believed his promises and thought he would change. But, after we married, his behaviour got worse. He would come home from work and just snap. He said he would commit suicide if I ever left. The more I stayed with him the more it destroyed my self-esteem. I felt brainwashed by him, convincing myself that I was useless and wouldn\u2019t survive without him. I was very dependent on him and didn\u2019t have any real support because I was living away from my family in a new country. \n\n \n\nHow my situation changed\n\nI\u2019d just given birth to our baby. He told me I was of no use sexually and that he didn\u2019t love me. Then he came home one night and tried to strangle me as I was sleeping. My brother was staying with me at the time and heard my screaming. He saved my life. \n\nI didn\u2019t call the police because I wasn\u2019t sure if they\u2019d take me seriously. Instead, I called the local community centre the next day to ask to see a marriage counsellor, but they told me \u201cYou don\u2019t need a counsellor, you need to come in. Your life is in danger.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time I got professional help. The community centre organised for me to stay in a refuge with the kids. No one knew where I was. He contacted my friends and people that I knew demanding to know where we were safe because no one knew where the refuge was.\n\n \n\nRegaining my sense of self\n\nOnce I left the relationship, I slowly found myself again. I realised how capable I am. I went back to university and then got a stable job.\n\nI recently met someone new. It took a long time. I didn\u2019t trust that someone could be kind and loving to me and my children. I also wasn\u2019t sure that I trusted my own judgement. But my new partner is great. He treats me with respect and as an equal, and I feel safe. \n\n \n\nWhat the experience taught me \n\nI learnt a lot of lessons the hardest possible way. If I had a friend who was going through a similar situation, this is what I would tell her.\n\nTalk to someone you trust and feel safe with.  \n\nTry to have some time apart from your partner. Think back to before you met him, and see how your life has changed since then. Has it changed for the better?\n\nWrite down or document what is happening to you and how it made you feel. It can be too easy to block out the abuse and just remember when he\u2019s being nice to you.\n\nUnderstand that there are many forms of abuse \u2013 physical, emotional, financial, sexual. All of them will hurt you in some way.\n\nDon\u2019t ignore his bad behaviour. If he really loves you he will not treat you like that.\n\nFind professional help. It can literally save your life.",

Initially my ex was fun, complimentary, encouraging, understanding - all the things you would want in a partner. I told him things I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone else; I felt like he was really trustworthy and had my back.\n\nThat really good phase lasted about nine months, but I realise now that it was a made up fantasy and the person he presented to hook me in doesn\u2019t exist. The compliments turned into insults; \u201cyou\u2019re so good at your job\u201d turned into \u201cyou\u2019re so condescending, you\u2019re such a know it all\u201d. Really personal information I had told him became things to twist and throw back at me as evidence I was f*cked up and dysfunctional.\n\nVerbal attacks\nThere were insults about my appearance, my interests, family and friends, but these would change so I never knew how I was supposed to be and whatever I tried was wrong. I started to realise it had become an abusive relationship and my close friends were worried about me.\n\nBy then though, I was so stuck, I kept thinking that if I changed how I was, \u2018supported\u2019 him better (code for doing everything he wanted and not questioning it) kept going through this tricky phase etc that things would go back to the way they were at the beginning. I know everyone says that - I think it\u2019s because they\u2019re so good at convincing you their behaviour is all your fault.\n\nStruggling to cope\nOver time the relationship became so abusive and destructive I was drinking and using drugs to try and deal with how I felt. I withdrew from friends and family, gave up my job and was emotionally unavailable to my children as I was so pre-occupied with trying to please him I\u2019d lost all sense of myself. I felt like a shell with nothing inside, like I would be sitting on the sofa with people around me talking and there was nothing left of me there, who I was didn\u2019t exist anymore.\n\nThe abuse was mainly verbal and psychological but there were peaks of physical and sexual violence that kept me in fear of him all the time and I thought a few times that he was going to kill me.\n\nThe things that \u2018upset\u2019 him were never predictable but he was obsessed about what people thought of him and would get angry if he felt I made him look stupid. In reality though it would be ridiculous, like helping his friend look for a lost lighter \u201cfor too long\u201d (a couple of minutes) as somehow this meant I had more loyalty to his friend than to him, or wishing his friend a happy birthday before he had, as apparently that meant I was trying to show him up.\n\nLiving in fear\nIf we had a few good days, I\u2019d be waiting for it to change as I knew it wouldn\u2019t last. The constant fear made me anxious all the time, having panic attacks and crying at everything. I was too scared to tell anyone how bad it was so I just kept everything bottled up.\n\nWhen I was pregnant he tried to kill me. I wanted to keep the baby and he didn\u2019t, but this time I wanted to stand my ground and not to do what he wanted, so I told him I wouldn\u2019t have a termination. He physically attacked me and said he was going to kill me, I looked at his face as he was strangling me and I thought there was no way I would get out alive.\n\nI still remember everything he said to me, that he would kill me before the police got there, that he would smash a bottle into my neck and he would cut the baby out. I remember realising I wouldn\u2019t be able to escape as he had me trapped and was fast and much stronger than me. I can still feel the fear and how I was thinking I was going to be killed and someone would have to tell my children.\n\nCalling the police\nSomehow I managed to talk him round, telling him I would do as he asked and have a termination. He stopped attacking me eventually but then he raped me. When he fell asleep I got out the house and went to a friend\u2019s who said I should call the police.\n\nThe police I\u2019ve met through all of this were really nice and supportive, but they don\u2019t realise how hard it is when someone you\u2019ve loved or who you have children with is abusive. It really messes with your head and is not as simple as dealing with any other crime.\n\nEven after that incident he managed to get me back in his life, once the attention of the police went away and he was on bail, he got in touch and told me how sorry he was and how much he loved me and put huge amounts of pressure on me. Really I think it was that he wanted me to drop the charges and make sure he didn\u2019t get convicted and knew he had to get me back on side.\n\nAfter this he threatened suicide every day and screamed in my face all the time that I had betrayed him by calling the police. I felt completely trapped. He said I had to make things right as it was my fault he was facing prison. I covered up for him in court and in the end he was found not guilty. I thought everything would be better after that but he didn\u2019t change.\n\nPregnancy\nSometimes I would sit in my car crying hysterically thinking \u201cplease someone save me\u201d. My pregnancy was horrific, I never got to feel excited or look forward to the baby, every single day was about him. The birth was horrible as I spent all the time worrying about how he would react to the staff giving me so much attention. Things continued like this for months and I guess I just realised it would never change and even now he had a child, he still wanted everything to revolve around him. I started to plan to get away and spent less and less time with him. I was really, really frightened though, I thought constantly about what he would do and how he might come and kill me.\n\nContacting RISE\nI phoned the RISE helpline and got advice from them about how to end the relationship and what to do afterwards. Although I was scared I knew I couldn\u2019t live like this anymore and ended the relationship.\n\nSince then I\u2019ve been more involved with RISE and have got a lot of strength and confidence from meeting women in the same situation. It\u2019s shocking to hear how many relationships followed exactly the same pattern.\n\nShame and self-blame\nI used to feel so ashamed about being in an abusive relationship, I couldn\u2019t believe it had happened to me and felt so stupid. What I realise now through working with RISE is that perpetrators are so skilled at breaking you down and making you think you\u2019re crazy, worthless and that it\u2019s your fault. I know I did nothing to deserve what he did to me and I\u2019m a good person.\n\nI had therapy through RISE that focussed on trauma and it really did change my life, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford it privately but the RISE sessions were subsidised. I\u2019m really grateful to everyone at RISE for their support, they\u2019ve made me feel really welcome.\n\nSince being involved with RISE and Survivors Network, I feel able to be open with people about my experiences as I think the culture of shame and secrecy needs to stop. RISE is so vital to be able to support, advise and hold people in crisis and when they\u2019re rebuilding their lives. I\u2019ve attended different events with RISE and I\u2019ve met other survivors who have amazed me with their unconditional support.\n\nI\u2019m slowly getting better but I know it\u2019s going to take time, I have good weeks and bad weeks and suffer from severe anxiety and depression. I\u2019ve lost friends and family members since all this, people who got angry at me because I couldn\u2019t leave, not understanding what life was like for me and how it wasn\u2019t that simple at all. Now I have a small circle of amazing friends who I can be honest with about how I\u2019m feeling. Maybe I\u2019ll always be scared of him but he no longer has control over me, bit by bit I\u2019m feeling like me again and feel positive about the future.\n\n",

To those of you reading who have been victims of domestic abuse, to those who are victims now, and especially to those who will become a victim of domestic abuse, I promise you there is hope. You chose to read this today for a reason. Before I get into my story, I want you to pause for a moment. I want you to ask yourself why did you choose to read this, and who are you reading for? What are your hopes to gain today? And as you are reflecting on how you are feeling and what you are thinking, I invite you to be fully present and engaged in the topic I am discussing.\n\nI share my story with you to further clarify what it is like to be a victim of domestic violence, to understand myself as a survivor of domestic violence and reflect on the impact of this journey both personally and professionally. I also want to provide support and comfort to those who have or will suffer from domestic violence.\n\nThis is my story\n\nMy name is Demi Lynn Moore.\nI save lives for a living.\nI have a passion for health, well-being, and fitness.\nI am strong, proud, and confident.\nI am an educated woman pursuing a doctorate degree.\nBut on top of all of that, I was a victim of domestic violence.\n\nI am 31 years old. I was born and raised in Pennsylvania and I have two loving and supportive parents, Shelly and Larry Moore. I am an only child. Growing up I attended school, received good grades, participated in school activities, and I was captain of the cheerleading squad. I had a lot of friends and enjoyed life. That\u2019s when it all changed. In October of 2006, I met my first ex-abuser. He was cute and charming. I enjoyed the extra attention and flattery, yet I was unaware that his flattery was a potential early warning sign of domestic abuse. He displayed a lot jealous traits and manipulative behaviors that I ignored because I was swayed with his charming personality. Or so I thought.\n\nResearch suggests: If a man has history of jealousy, possessiveness, and the ability to be charming, manipulative, and seductive to get what he wants, and hostile, nasty and mean when he doesn\u2019t succeed, the risk for battering becomes very high.\n\nIn December of 2006, the two of us were driving to Philadelphia to visit a relative of his and an argument started for a reason I can no longer remember. He proceeded to punch me in the left side of the face, causing my head to slam against the passenger side window. At that time, I did not know what to think. Was this real? Did this really just happen? I was confused and not thinking clearly. I had never experienced this before.\n\nDuring another argument, he threw me through his closet doors, and the last time he put his hands on me he threw me down his spiral staircase. After tumbling down and trying to understand what happened, I truly feared for my life. I was able to get to my feet and run out the back door to my car. As I was backing out of his driveway, looking in my mirror for other cars, I stopped to put my car in drive. I looked to my left, and he was standing there with a metal baseball bat. I quickly sped out of his driveway and got away.\n\nFor months, he continued to contact me and even going as far as saying he was outside of my parents\u2019 house. It was in that moment, I had no other choice but to finally disclose some, not all, of the information to my parents. The local police in his neighborhood were notified and due to them being uninterested in helping me, I did not press charges or have him arrested. I requested that he leave me alone.\n\nYou\u2019re probably sitting there wondering why my parents didn\u2019t get more involved. I was a cheerleader still at the time, so coming home with bruises was not out of the ordinary. It was easy to hide it from them. I did not grow up in a house with domestic violence so this was new to me and I was not sure how to deal with it or process it all.\n\nIn June 2007, I graduated high school with very low self-esteem resulting from this. The low self-esteem continued as I began college. Looking back now, I demonstrated depressive behaviors. I had a loss of energy, yet I could not sleep. I was always agitated and restless and I continuously criticized myself for my perceived mistakes. I had little, if any, self \u2013 confidence. I did not believe that I had any personal value or self -worth.\n\nI did not think it could get any worse until tragedy struck again when I developed an eating disorder stemming from the abuse. I struggled with self-image and by sophomore year of college my eating disorder was out of control. For the next year, I continued to hide that from my parents once again out of embarrassment. I lived at school, so again it was easy to hide. The eating disorder was taking over. I was found lying on the bathroom floor by a campus security guard after passing out. Finally, my senior year, my secret was out. My roommates figured out what was wrong with me and went to a counselor on campus who then notified my parents. At that point I had to confess to my parents I had an eating disorder. I moved home for my last semester. I was slowly dying. The eating disorder was going to win if I did not get help.\n\nStill, through all of this I graduated from college in 2011, Summa Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology and a Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice. I knew that dealing with being abused and low self-esteem, and now an eating disorder, I had to do something to prevent this from ever happening again.\n\nI was introduced to Krav Maga which is a self-defense and fighting system developed for Israeli Defense Forces. A combination of my fight training, and going to the gym, I actually started to feel a little better about myself, but I still was not eating properly. I was eventually introduced to a personal trainer who taught me proper techniques of working out, but more importantly she showed me the proper way to eat, finally convincing me that with proper nutrition, combined with training, I could eat and lose weight a health way. I finally developed the body I was looking for and a new passion in life for physical fitness training.\n\nAt this stage in my life, I obtained a job with the State Police, and in 2012 I began my career. Life was perfect, right? Wrong.Within a year after beginning my career, I met and started dating my second ex-abuser. After all I had been through and after climbing out of my emotional dark hole, three months into us dating, I was once again a victim of domestic violence.\n\nThe verbal and physical abuse I endured in this relationship was far worse than anything in my past. The verbal abuse was every day and the physical abuse was a few times a week. By this time, I was living in my own apartment, and he eventually moved in with me. It started with him slapping me across the face, but quickly progressed to him coming after me with a butcher knife, and sleeping every night with a loaded gun under his pillow, to him eventually holding the loaded gun to my head, waking up looking down the barrel of the gun, to him attempting to set me on fire, destroying my apartment, punching and kicking me in the legs, stomach, ribs and face.\n\nHe went through my phone and deleted every single male that was in my phone, even if they were family or co-workers. He knew all of my passwords to my email accounts as well as my social media accounts so he could \u201ccheck up on me\u201d anytime he wanted. He knew where I was at all times. He knew when I was to leave for work, and when I was to return home. If I was a minute late, I was in trouble. I could not go to the store alone, I could not go see my parents alone, and I definitely could not hang out with my friends alone or go to the gym alone. He degraded me in the lowest of ways you can degrade a human.\n\nI was extremely close to my family and he was not, therefore he resented me for that. We could not attend family functions and if we did, we either got there late due to an argument or he would start an argument while we were there so we would have to leave early. I was running out of excuses to make for him. He would tell me I can only talk to my parents once a day so I would try to get all of my calls into them while I was at work and out of the house. I was being isolated from my family and I was losing friends because I could not tell anyone what was going on. I was a prisoner within my own home.\nDuring this time, he was not working. I was the only income, paying all of the bills, rent, my student loans, his car payment, our gym memberships and phone bills. I was going broke. I knew there was a problem when I had a full-time job, yet had to ask my parents for money to put gas in my car because I did not have any.\n\nWith all of the abuse, and how unstable we were, he thought it would be a great idea to get a dog. He thought it would \u201cbring us closer together,\u201d I guess like a child. To save an argument we did. I of course paid for my now six year old miniature dachshund. I always say I am not sure who saved who, but I thank God for him because I feel like he saved me.\n\nBy now you have to be wondering what happened next? She left him right? Well not exactly. In September of 2014, it got worse. I do not know what was worse the fact that he actually proposed to me, or the fact that I accepted a marriage proposal from a man that has tried to kill me numerous times. On the outside I was portraying this happy couple I had a nice diamond to show off and I had become such a professional at hiding the abuse and having all of my family and friends thinking we were a happy couple. I began to tell myself, \u201cthis is going to be my life\u2026but it can\u2019t be.\u201d I was smiling on the outside, but on the inside, I was dying.\n\nYou have to also be thinking, \u201cShe\u2019s a cop, why doesn\u2019t she have him arrested?\u201d Eventually my work did find out about some of the abuse. I can only use so much makeup to cover up the bruises. I was called in by my superiors for questioning, yet they did not arrest him. It is only within the last ten years that Intimate Partner Violence or domestic violence has been taken seriously as a criminal justice issue within the national context of our country so I could not understand why they were unable to see the fact that I was crying out for help. That night after I was called in for questioning, he told me if he got arrested he would kill me first and make it look like a suicide. He eventually began calling and harassing me while I was at work.\n\nBy January 2015, I had enough. January 23rd he was out drinking with friends. I got up for work at 3am and he was not home. I called him and naturally he cursed me out yet eventually showed up at home with a friend. He and his friend eventually walked in the door and went to the main bedroom and went to sleep. I wanted answers so I walked back to ask him where he was at this hour and more importantly how did he get home. He stood up and threw me against the wall. While continuing to use profanity, he told me I did not have the right to ask him these questions. I reminded him that I was his fianc\u00e9 so I did have the right to ask. He never answered so I walked out into the living room.\n\nAs I made it out there, he came running down the hall. He threw a candle at the wall and it smashed. I could see my puppy under the kitchen table and I can still to this day hear his yelp as he was crying. He ripped the hallway closet doors off of the hinges. He did not care. He was not responsible for any of the damage. He then picked me up by my neck with both of his hands around my neck and began to strangle me. As he did so, he was also and slamming me into the front door. His friend came running out and was yelling for him to let go of me. Eventually he put me down, and as I could feel myself fading in and out, he punched me in the face. I fell to the ground and I could see him coming back for another punch until his friend jumped in.\n\nThe room went black, but I could still hear their voices so I knew I was alive. He said to his friend, \u201cIf the cops come, tell them she hit me first.\u201d His friend said, \u201cNo I just watched you lay your fianc\u00e9 out in front of me and we don\u2019t even know if she is alive.\u201d The two ended up leaving after that. Once I realized they were gone, I knew if I did not end this relationship, either he was going to kill me, or I was going to kill him. Someone was going to end up dead.\n\nJanuary 25th was it, I had enough. I told him the relationship was over and he needed to come pick up his stuff. I do not think he believed me. I made sure my family was there when he eventually showed up with his friend. He was shocked to see I really had his stuff packed and this was the end. Box by box he carried them out making comments but I ignored them. On January 25, 2015 that night for the first time in 3 years, I slept with both eyes shut.\n\nOne of the best predictions of future violence is a history of past violent behavior. When my relationship ended with him, I was contacted by one of his ex-girlfriends who told me that she wished she only reached out sooner. She told me when she was with him she experienced some of the same violent behavior that I went through. And as time went on, the girlfriends after me would reach out to me asking if I had experienced any of his violent behavior. Yet we all concluded that I seemed to get the worst of it.\n\nTurning the Page for a Better Life\n\nDuring this disastrous relationship, as you can imagine I relapsed with the eating disorder. Here I was once again at the bottom of a dark hole. In 2017, I decided to go back to school and pursue my Master\u2019s Degree. He did not have a college education and hated the fact that I did, therefore he would not allow me to continue school while with him and I could not afford it because of him. Since then, I have gone to a counselor which helped me overcome some, not all of the emotional distress. I have joined a new gym and I train harder than ever which has always been one of my true passions. Counseling is a great tool however I found the best therapy to be the gym, talking with my family and friends and most of all, sharing my story.\n\nIn May of 2019, I successfully graduated with my Master\u2019s Degree from and in September 2019, I began pursuing my doctorate degree.\n\nA Bright Future Ahead\n\nI share my story with you not for sympathy, but in hopes of saving someone else\u2019s life. The questions often come up, \u201cWhy did you stay so long?\u201d Or \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just leave?\u201d There are numerous reasons why someone doesn\u2019t just leave, and why someone stays in a relationship that could kill them. Fear. There was a fear of staying and a fear of leaving. Statistics show that in a domestic abuse situation, if the abuser has access to a gun, which we had, it will increase the chances that the woman will die by 500 percent. It\u2019s incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser, because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is: kill her.\n\nIn closing, domestic violence thought I would die unhappy and unloved at the hands of my abuser. God had other plans. I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to share my story with you. I hope that it has been educational and helpful. I hope that if anyone reading today is in the midst of a violent relationship or you know anyone who is, you can see with me here today there is a way out. I am here to tell you that that there is a group among us who suffers alone because keeping silent appears safer than speaking out. To break the silence it brings pain, shame, rejection, and suffering. So they keep it in and feel alone.\n\nI often found myself reflecting on the words of one researcher: It takes a long time to forgive yourself, especially if you are a person who tends to be hard on yourself. You probably can\u2019t believe that you, of all people, got involved with a toxic man. Maybe you saw the signs, yet you remained in the relationship in order to fix him or change him. Once I began to believe in myself, I began to understand that my story was impactful and I could make a difference. I decided to no longer hide from my experiences as a victim of domestic abuse; instead, I embraced my encounters and became a more resilient survivor and took control of my entire existence. I realized that I could never again allow myself to become a victim of domestic violence if I truly wanted to obtain authenticity. I was now not a victim, but a survivor.\n\nAs my journey continues, I hope to leave you with this message. Domestic violence does not discriminate. There is no one story fits all and each story is unique. There is a light at the end of the dark tunnel and you do not have to live in darkness forever. Please continue to follow my journey as I take my tragedy and turn it into a triumph. Keep an eye out for my upcoming book releasing this year, A Trooper in Moore Ways than You Know where I share my entire story.",

The first person I saw was the receptionist and I explained to her, with tears in my eyes, that I was going through domestic abuse. I met with a therapist named Liz B. She explained to me that I have the option to receive individual counseling and once I\u2019m done counseling, I could be part of a support group. Counseling was about two or three months, but I remember it like it was yesterday. When I first sat down with Liz I explained to her the type of abuse that I was going through with my husband. I was dealing with the mental abuse of not feeling beautiful, being told that I\u2019m boring, him saying he didn\u2019t love me, and no longer wanting to be in this marriage. Along with the emotional abuse, he would come home late at night drunk knowing that he\u2019s been  with other women. At times I would wake up knowing he wasn\u2019t coming home. He did not provide any financial support and I felt abandoned. He would constantly get us evicted and  it was a lot to handle.\n\nMy husband would constantly tell me I was lazy, getting fat, and he would talk about other women in front of me. I started to believe that I wasn\u2019t pretty or smart enough to have a man like my husband and believed that he was the best that I could ever have.  I would compare myself to women in the magazines, commercials, and women walking down the street, wishing if I can only be the woman that he wants or needs me to be. I was so hard on myself every day. I would find myself fighting for my self-worth, thinking if we got into a fight, he would see how much I loved him even if it ended in a black eye or lip. His mental, emotional, & physical abuse was overwhelming. During this time I looked forward to meeting with Liz so I could share with her all the abuse and neglect I was experiencing.\n\nEven though he treated me bad and I tried to leave, I would always end up going back.. It became so overwhelming that I found myself fighting back with my husband when I knew that it could have put me in jail for a mighty long time! Just as much as I was being abused, I found myself being an abuser as well.\n\nI was able to use both my individual counseling and group support sessions to help me work through this all. I will never forget all that was poured into me behind the Domestic Abuse Project of Delaware County. I\u2019m a survivor of 2021. DAP has given me my sanity back, belief in myself, and peace of mind. I have learned so much through the services provided: mountain meditation scriptures, understanding healthy relationships, trust, accountability, safety, honesty, support cooperation, and RESPECT.\n\nOnce I finished my individual and group sessions it was bittersweet to know  all the beautiful women I met through my time with DAP. We exchanged phone numbers to help support each other.  Shortly after the group session, I was enrolled with JJ Peterson mental health facility. While there, I continued to learn many tools to help me overcome domestic abuse and I am proud to say I am a survivor! I am involved with my church Ministry and as a volunteer with DAP. I am also looking to reopen my business, build a better relationship with friends and family, and continue the journey of self-care. Sometimes all it takes is a knock at the door and the time to listen to hear someone else\u2019s story. My passion now is to help those in need by sharing my story, just like DAP helped me.",

Never would I have thought in a million years that I would have an opportunity to share my journey with the hopes of helping someone else find their freedom as well.\n\nI will never forget the day. The day I had awaken and realized that I had enough. Enough of the Physical, Emotional and Verbal Abuse. However, the day before I made such a drastic decision for both my life and my children\u2019s life, let me take a moment to share the unfortunate events that led up to my decision. I remember getting ready for work like any typical day. I could sense that my abuser was in a horrible mood. I tried with everything in my power to stay clear of him. Why, you ask? Well, one of the things that I\u2019ve learned while dealing with an abuser is to try your best not to ruffle their feathers or they will make you pay. In my case on this particular day, staying clear did not help me at all. My abuser was looking for a fight and a fight is just what I gave him. I was tired, Tired in my mind, body and soul. Just tired. For the many years that I put up with the abuse I never fought back because I was always afraid that he\u2019d kill me. But this day I was just tired, Not even afraid of death at this point. We fought and fought and like normal, I got myself together and still headed in to work like nothing happened like life was beautiful. Portraying an Image that was not me. What I didn\u2019t know nor was I prepared for is that my abuser was about to do something that he\u2019s never done in the years that he and I were in a relationship and that was he came to my job. He came to my job to continue what was started at home. I was grateful enough to not have loss my job at the time but it left me in such a dark place.\n\nEven in that dark place I knew in my heart that I was ready, I was ready to leave. The next morning, I waited, I waited for my abuser to leave for work. Once he was gone, I remember sitting in my bathroom as I begin to google different places in Delaware County desperate for some assistance. DAP, (Dap of Media PA) Was the first place that popped up and immediately I reached out. Man was I scared. There was so much running through my mind at the time but DAP was my life savior in that moment. I wish that I could remember the advocate\u2019s name of who I spoke with during that call. What I will say is her voice was very soothing and she was extremely compassionate.\n\nDAP did something for me that changed my life for the betterment of me and my children. I was accepted into the Safe House. One of the things that Dap provided me and my girls with was Peace and Safety. Peace was so important for all of us because we hadn\u2019t experienced peace in a very long time. Not only did I find peace at the safe house, I was given a second chance at new beginnings. My children were safe and we were able to return to the safe house each night for the next 60 days knowing that I could lay my head down at night without worrying about being awaken by someone standing over top of me and pounding on me for absolutely nothing. What an amazing feeling it was for me to reestablish stability for my family while gaining so much support from DAP. One of the other things that I learned during this time as well is that stability is not the cure to the trauma that a person experience through abuse. I fought for my freedom because I wanted it so bad. You really have to want it bad enough. I went to counselling even when I didn\u2019t feel like going. Counselling is a huge part of your healing process. Trauma is huge and needs to be treated as such! I also quoted a lot of affirmations daily until I believe the power behind the words that I was speaking. Every single day I told myself that I was strong, I was worthy, I was powerful and beautiful. Today 5 years later I believe Every word and it shows!\n\nI\u2019ve always wanted to give back just as a way of saying thank you with the hopes of having the opportunity to one day help someone the same way that Dap stepped in and helped me. Almost a year ago I decided to reach out to Joy Cason (Director of Dap\u2019s safe house) Through email inquiring about having any part time positions. I really wasn\u2019t expecting Joy to respond at all but to my surprise not only did Joy respond right away, She let me know that she was looking for a weekend Advocate. March 2021 will make one year and here I am the person on the other side giving victims just what was given to me 5 years ago. I am what you call a Survivor!",

      "content": "It was my fault. He won\u2019t do it again. I love him. He promised me he would change. I could give a million reasons why I stayed and why I returned to my abuser over and over. I struggled with drug addiction for more than half of my life. It was easy to believe that everything was my fault. It was my first relationship, and I admit I wasn\u2019t perfect either. I was young, and I moved in with him after being kicked out of my parents\u2019 house for using drugs. We had some small fights until one night he came home, and I could tell he was high. He went into a rage and I thought he was going to kill me.\n\nI spent hours trying to get to my phone and call the police. I finally did manage to call just before he smashed my phone. This only made it worse. He was breaking everything around us \u2013 tables, chairs, doors. I was attacked by the dog while jumping down half a flight of stairs to get away and didn\u2019t make it out. I held on until the police knocked at the door. He was holding me down as I kicked and squirmed. I tried to scream with every breath until, thank God, they broke the door down. I didn\u2019t press charges and I lied for him. I did, however, manage to leave him. I swore never again.\n\nAfter being single for a while, I met a successful man. He was different than anybody I had ever dated. It started amazing and exactly what I thought a normal relationship would be like. Before long, it was a disaster and I was covered in bruises and marks on my neck from him grabbing me by my throat. I didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go and he was there for me. He told me he loved me and that he was the only one that cared about me. Still, in the grips of my addiction, I believed him. I was stuck and without him, I was homeless again. One day he brought home a puppy, Riley, who became the best friend I ever had. Unfortunately, Riley became a punching bag as well. I never did get the courage to leave on my own. I was eventually arrested and sent to state prison. For the first time in a long time, I finally felt free. I swore never again.\n\nI was released from prison in March 2017 and finally got clean on April 22, 2017. I slowly began to turn my life around. I worked on myself and my recovery. I got my place, worked towards a promotion at work, and started my first career. I became a strong, independent woman in recovery that other women looked up to. I even took Riley from my ex. Riley looked like he had been starved, his ribs were showing, and he had no energy or life in his eyes. I was finally able to give him a safe home.\n\nEverything was amazing, and then I met him. The man of my dreams was handsome, charming and the chemistry was amazing. He made me feel like I was perfect, like I was special. I fell head over heels in love and then the lies began to reveal themselves. It was one heart-wrenching nightmare after another. I was ashamed that even as a sober woman he was able to break me down. The first time he put his hands on me he blamed it on being high and I forgave him. The problem was that he was high all the time and I couldn\u2019t trust him. I spent what was supposed to be our vacation alone in the hotel after he beat me up, stole my money, and went to another woman\u2019s house. I tried to leave several times. He stalked me, slept on my steps, and repeatedly broke into my building. I took him back every time until I got so tired and so numb I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I just wanted it to stop, I just wanted him to go away, and I ended it for good. He appeared everywhere for a couple of months, I was so scared. He hacked into my social media accounts at one point and threatened me with pictures that he stole. I felt completely violated but he did eventually go away.\n\nI feel safe now. I\u2019ve finally been able to focus on building my life and chasing my dreams. I am truly happier than I have ever been in my life. I pray never again. I am happy. I am free.

      "content": "My story is one of overcoming, self discovery, and redefining the warrior within. Some might say that I don\u2019t fit the mold of a victim of domestic violence, since I am a trained Professional Fighter. But I am here to tell you that Domestic Abuse does not discriminate. It CAN and DOES affect all walks of life.\n\nFor six and a half years, I endured extreme emotional, mental, physical, and even financial abuse at the hands of my ex-partner. I was completely isolated, broken, and defeated. It wasn't only my life that was in jeopardy, but also that of my daughter. She depended on me for her safety, happiness, and security. So, I became a master at masking the hell I was living in and created a double life. I concealed my pain with a brave face as if everything was perfectly fine. But the truth was, I was suffering immensely. And as my pretend world began to crumble, I did too.\n\nI was afraid to tell anyone what was happening in my home \u2013 afraid that no one would believe me, especially since we both had high profile roles in the Martial Arts Community. With my family in another state and no friends, I was alone, without anyone to turn to.\n\nIt takes a lot of courage to face your fears and accept where you are, especially when you\u2019re experiencing trauma on an almost daily basis. I had to decide whether to leave and live, or to stay and succumb to the consequences.\n\nSome people might think that being physically abused while pregnant would be reason enough to leave; or being told that I was fat, stupid, and would never amount to anything. I was being isolated like a prisoner, and mentally tortured on a daily basis. He controlled my physical appearance, where I went, who I spoke to, and even my thoughts! He broke my spirit down to the point that I gave up my own dreams and aspirations.\n\nI tried to leave, but I had no possessions, food, shelter or basic necessities. My daughter and I walked the streets of Center City with a bag of clothes and a few of her favorite toys stacked on top of her stroller.\n\nWithout a plan and uncertain where we would spend the night, I experienced what homelessness and HOPELESSNESS felt like. I felt a profound sense of defeat. I thought I had failed my daughter.\n\nOne night, when I went back to our apartment for more clothes, he attacked me. I barely escaped, and ran to the nearest police station with my daughter. But the police ended up arresting ME when my ex falsely claimed that HE was being abused! I was released later that day, but my worst fear had come true \u2013 my ex had our daughter. I spent an agonizing 10 days apart from my baby, while waiting for our custody hearing.\n\nI was terrified that something would happen to her. We shared custody for four frustrating and fear-filled years, until my ex\u2019s true side finally revealed itself to the judge.\n\nFrom the moment I fled, I learned about Women Against Abuse. I called the Hotline several times a day in an effort to secure a bed at one of their Safe Havens. I used every single resource that was given to me, including the Legal Center. I quickly realized that NONE of it was going to come easy, nor was anyone going to save me. I learned that I had to be relentless in my pursuit of safety, shelter, and support. I refused to take NO for an answer. And, eventually, my persistence paid off.\n\nAs I walked through the doors of the safe haven, I finally felt like I could let my guard down. In a single moment, years and years of abuse came crashing off my shoulders, and I felt a weight had lifted, which then gave birth to a new outlook. This was my chance to take my life back.\n\nWhile at the Safe Haven, I learned the prerequisite for beginning again was forgiveness. I had to completely strip myself of any and all negativity. His way of still controlling me lied in the bitterness, resentment, and blame that I harbored inside. I finally let it go.\n\nI was NOT a victim. I had SURVIVED.\n\nI took responsibility for my life and my daughter's in that moment. It wasn't our fault that we were in this position, but it was my duty to carry on. By taking my power back, I completely changed the trajectory of our lives. I discovered self-love. I learned to accept my WHOLE self, imperfections and all. I no longer felt ashamed and unworthy. I was bound and determined to be the mother that my daughter deserved, and finally break the cycle of Domestic Abuse. Everything he said I couldn\u2019t do, I went on to achieve \u2013 and more!\n\nI didn\u2019t know it at the time, but I was being shaped and molded into a powerful force. I went from being homeless, broken, insecure, and defeated; to a driven and confident advocate, coach, speaker, and influencer. My voice has been heard on every platform, from Seventeen Magazine, to The University of Pennsylvania, all the way to the State Capitol. I even went on to win my first World Title along the way!\n\nToday, I\u2019m grateful to be in a healthy relationship with a wonderful partner. Looking back, I can see now that our hardships are designed to make us stronger. Each of us has the ability to bounce back, but we have to be willing to work for it. To say NO, and take a stand, even at the highest stakes. The moment we let our circumstances define us, will almost certainly be the thing that keeps us suffering. So, let your experiences be used to fuel a mission of awareness, empathy, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 to spread love.\n\nIn closing, I have a quote that means a lot to me, and I would like to gift it to all of you:\n\nOnce in a while, take the time to encourage yourself. Remind yourself that life is a process of weathering and rebuilding. Be kind to yourself as you heal and learn. There is purpose in your journey. There is light in your heart. There is a future waiting for you. Remember that, and trust.",

Eventually, this phone surveillance extended to other parts of the day until he was monitoring her 24/7, listening even as she slept at night.\n\nAfter a few months of dating, Beverly found out she was pregnant. Her abuser promised he would change, but he did not; the abuse continued. One day, the abuse landed Beverly in the hospital, and she worked up the nerve to leave him the next day. But at that point, she had already experienced so much trauma and anxiety during her pregnancy that she ended up giving birth prematurely.\n\nMonths later, Beverly found out that her abuser and his friends were posting violent threats about her on social media. Fearing for her safety and the safety her child, she applied for a restraining order. But the trial court ruled that Beverly did not need protection because she had waited 5 months since the last instance of physical abuse to apply for a protective order. The court also incorrectly stated that domestic violence restraining orders do not extend to survivors of non-physical abuse.\n\nBut Beverly didn\u2019t give up. She sought out help from the Family Violence Appellate Project and the Los Angeles Center for Law and Justice, to appeal the decision and get the protection she needed for herself and her child.

Her mother was contacted by the doctor and was absolutely terrified and heartbroken to hear of her daughter\u2019s condition. Immediately, she drove from her home in South Carolina to Florida to be by Blanche\u2019s side. Her mother was very supportive and felt like Blanche was safe, protected, and in good hands when she was in the hospital.\n\n\u201cIt all happened so fast. By the time I woke up in the hospital, I felt overwhelmed. I was in complete shell shock. Everyone around me had already found out and I didn't even know how yet. It was the most difficult situation I had been through in my whole life. I was just so relieved to have my mother\u2019s support. I was so lost and had no idea how to restart my life all over.\u201d The chief of medicine at the hospital gave orders to only release Blanche to a protected domestic violence shelter. The social workers then relocated Blanche. Now, she would be safe and could access resources to assist her in moving forward. Blanche knew the road ahead would have challenges. However, she did not know that this horrific incident landed her and her ex-husband on the front page of the newspaper and national news outlets. \u201cIt was very shocking at first. I never thought that would happen to me. As hard as everything was to accept, it ended up helping me so much in the healing journey. I didn\u2019t have to explain my story to anyone really. For myself, all of that attention just reminded me of what I just survived and how I would never look back again. My whole life changed. I took my wedding rings off and started healing. I\u2019m thankful the media did not portray my story out of context. I pray that by it being in the media, it helps someone.\u201d\n\nLooking back on her marriage, Blanche can now recount the early signs of her husband\u2019s abusive behavior.\n\n\u201cWe were married for six years and had one son before the incident happened. Leading up to the incident, he was abusing drugs and heavy amounts of alcohol. He started suffering from bipolar schizophrenia episodes in which he refused any type of professional help. His alcoholism got so severe he failed his pancreas and became a Type 1 diabetic. He had complete control over my life. I had no family, no friends, and all my time was dedicated to his illnesses. There were so many red flags. It was unfortunate that many of them happened so quickly and led to a very horrific incident.\u201d\n\nFor those experiencing abuse and weighing the decision of whether or not to come forward, Blanche shares her thoughts for survivors.\n\n\u201cI would tell them that they can overcome this and the healing process is not an easy process but it\u2019s definitely worth it to have your life back after abuse.\u201d\n\nSexual violence most often is perpetrated by someone a survivor knows, and this includes intimate partners. Blanche shares what she wishes someone would have told her about marital abuse.\n\n\u201cI wish someone would have reached out when I started distancing everyone around me. I wish I had better knowledge of so many resources that could have helped me. I was living in a new state, completely dependent on my husband, and a stay at home mom. I would have left sooner if I had prior knowledge we would have been protected and safe. I am now divorced and know that marital abuse is a problem. It\u2019s very scary and a lot more people go through it than people want to believe.\u201d\n\nBlanche shares with us what has been most helpful in her healing journey.\n\n\u201cMy determination was most helpful.

(Dedeker practices polyamory, a form of non-monogamy in which someone has more than one romantic or sexual partner with the consent and knowledge of everyone involved.) A lack of resources and reporting options made Dedeker feel that she couldn\u2019t get help, and the abuse lasted for five months.\n\nDedeker also felt ashamed about the abuse and was afraid that the stigma about polyamory would make it impossible for others to understand or for her to get help.\n\n\u201cWhen I was still in the relationship, there were so many times I got so close to telling someone what was going on. I had this memory of being curled up on the couch with my mom on the phone and was so close to telling her. But I felt like I was going to be dropping a bomb and just exploding my life.\u201d\n\nOnce Dedeker returned to the U.S, she confided in a therapist about the abuse.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know at the time, but I really needed someone to tell me it\u2019s okay to break up with him.\u201d\n\nShe then confided in her mother, who also survived an abusive relationship.\n\n\u201cAt the time, she was the only person I knew who\u2019d experienced it. I just needed to hear from someone else that what happened was not okay.\u201d\n\nWhen Dedeker told her other partners, they had mixed responses. While both were supportive, it also brought up difficult feelings.\n\n\u201cThere was a sense of betrayal that I\u2019d kept this hidden.\u201d\n\nHer partners, however, reached out to one another and were able to brainstorm together on strategies to support her. This kind of support network, Dedeker says, was integral to her healing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always so scary to leave a relationship, but having that love and affection and stability there was just huge. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so ironic that people think of non-monogamous relationships as being unstable\u2014my experience has always been exactly the opposite.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving the relationship and coming forward about the abuse, Dedeker didn\u2019t yet feel the effects of the abuse.\n\n\u201cI was floating on a high of being out of the relationship.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until six months later that she began to experience Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Dedeker hit a low point in her experience with the effects of PTSD, and strugged with depression and thoughts of suicide.\n\n\u201cIt was a first for me to hit that emotional low. I knew I needed to do something and get some help.\u201d\n\nAfter having mixed experiences while looking for a therapist who was both trauma-informed and understanding of non-monogamy, Dedeker found a practitioner of somatic experiencing therapy, which she found beneficial to her healing.\n\n\u201cFinally being able to address what was going on in my body helped to free my voice to be able to talk about what happened.\u201d\n\nDedeker\u2019s advice to other survivors of intimate partner violence is to trust your gut.\n\n\u201cI wish I could have told myself, and had my younger self truly believe it, that it\u2019s worth it to speak up when you\u2019re first feeling like something is off. If you can tell someone you trust, who will hold you in a compassionate way, it\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\nDedeker advises partners of survivors to have open arms.\n\n\u201cHold them physically or emotionally, on a good day, a bad day, a confusing day; meet them where they\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nShe also encourages \u201ccompassionate curiosity.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe willing to listen, to ask what is helpful to your partner, to find out what you could do differently next time a trigger comes up.\u201d\n\nShe says it\u2019s okay to not know what to do at first\u2014\u201cWe aren\u2019t given a script for this\u201d\u2014but that it\u2019s important to seek an outside education and learn more.\n\nDedeker also finds healing in her own work. As a relationship coach and somatic experiencing practitioner in training, Dedeker has channeled her own experience into better supporting clients in abusive relationships.\n\n\u201cI found for the first time that sharing my own experience was something that could help my clients.\u201d\n\nHer work on her book and podcast also shifted after surviving abuse.\n\n\u201cHow can I talk about being any kind of authority on relationship advice while I\u2019m in an abusive relationship? How can I own up to having been in an abusive relationship while trying to be an expert on healthy communication?\u2019\u201d\n\nBeing open about her experience, however, allows Dedeker to be even more accessible and beneficial to others.\n\n\u201cMy work before was about empowering people, especially women, that they could choose the kind of relationship they wanted to have. Empowering people to choose good relationships and leave behind bad ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I want on a T-shirt or maybe my gravestone is the phrase \u2018no jerk is worth it.\u2019 You are worth so much more. Every single person is worth so much more than putting up with abusive behavior.\u201d",

I tell mine because I want my words to give someone else hope.\u201d\n\nElise Roberts is a professional dancer, dedicated friend, and visual artist in her spare time. She is also a survivor of intimate partner violence.\n\nAs a teenager, Elise experienced depression, bullying, and self-harm.\n\n\u201cI seemed like a happy, outgoing person\u2014but on the inside, I was hurting.\u201d\n\nWhen she was 17, she started dating someone who appeared kind at first, then started to change his behaviors. This developed into intimate partner violence. He physically, sexually, and emotionally abused her. He made her feel like she was not good enough for anyone else and that he was the only person who would ever love her.\n\n\n\nElise didn\u2019t tell anyone what was happening because she was having trouble identifying what was happening as abuse.\n\n\u201cWhen I was younger, I remember a boy in one of my classes was bullying me, and when I told the teacher about it, she said that boys are mean to girls because they like them and want to get their attention.\u201d\n\nThrough comments adults made and from watching TV and movies, Elise learned from a young age that someone picking on her meant they liked her.\n\n\u201cI was only 17. I just thought this is what relationships were. I didn\u2019t know any better. I knew that he was hurting me, but I didn\u2019t know how to talk about what was happening.\u201d\n\nElise continued to self-harm throughout the relationship and at one point attempted suicide. After the attempt, she went to the school counselor and told her what happened. The counselor held her hand, talked to her, and arranged for Elise to enter a two-week in-patient program and an out-patient program following that.\n\n\u201cAfter the suicide attempt, I had to teach myself how to be grateful for every little thing. Going through that process made me a better person.\u201d At first, Elise was hesitant to go to therapy. \u201cI was worried about the negative connotations of having depression. In my mind, only crazy people go to therapists. I was so wrong.\u201d\n\nTherapy became central for Elise\u2019s healing, especially through developing healthy coping mechanisms.\n\n\u201cI would give my therapist a million dollars if I could. She saved me. She was the person I wanted to tell everything to. I know I wasn\u2019t her best friend, but she was mine. Therapy should be so much more normalized, especially for high schoolers.\u201d\n\nElise hadn\u2019t told anyone about the abuse she experienced. But after a while, she felt safe to tell her therapist.\n\n\u201cThe first person I told was my therapist, who I owe my life to. The first time I ever shared out loud what was going on behind closed doors of the relationship was terrifying.\u201d\n\nElise\u2019s therapist gave her the number for RAINN\u2019s National Sexual Assault Hotline and told her that what happened to her wasn\u2019t her fault.\n\n\u201cThe hotline helped me so much because I could talk to someone I trusted, but I didn\u2019t need to worry about what they would think of me or if telling them would change our relationship.\u201d\n\nElise was able to leave the abusive relationship.\n\n\u201cI just felt so stupid for being in a relationship that turned out to be abusive. I felt like I should have been able to know this would happen.\u201d\n\nThe supportive reaction Elise\u2019s therapist showed made her feel like she could tell more people in her life. She told her best friend, who tried to be supportive by encouraging Elise to report what happened to the police and pursue a legal case. Elise explained that she had thought about it and made the decision not to move forward with reporting because she had heard so many negative stories of others who reported abuse and did not get the justice they deserved.\n\nIn Elise\u2019s first relationship after experiencing the abuse, she waited until she was comfortable to let her partner know that she might have flashbacks and he reacted in a supportive way.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel ready to tell him everything, but I felt like it would help me if he knew that this was something I was dealing with.\u201d\n\nElise also told her mother, though accidentally. When Elise was waking up from anesthesia after a surgery, her mother asked if she was in pain.\n\n\u201cI said that nothing hurts as much as what he used to do to me.\u201d\n\nWhen she was awake and back from the hospital, her mom let her know that Elise didn\u2019t have to tell her anything, but that she was there for her and that it was not her fault.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so grateful for the amount of support everyone has given me. Each person I told made me feel better about sharing my story.\u201d\n\nTo help ensure others don\u2019t have to go through what she experience, Elise believes that school, communities, and families should remove the taboo from talking about sexual violence.\n\n\u201cPeople avoid it because it\u2019s such a hard subject to talk about. But if I had known about warning signs of abuse, maybe it would have been easier for me to tell someone when it happened to me.\u201d\n\nIn addition to therapy, having visual art as an outlet has been central in Elise\u2019s healing. She has what she calls an alter-book. It\u2019s an old book that whenever she starts contemplating self-harm, she destroys or alters the book in the most artistic way she can.\n\n\u201cWhatever I\u2019m feeling goes into my book. I\u2019m not an artist by any means. I just put my feelings on the page. It helps me to see my progress when I look through the book, but it\u2019s not linear, it\u2019s a rollercoaster of emotions.\u201d\n\nIf Elise could tell survivors one thing, she would remind them that surviving sexual violence shows much more about who you are\u2014the strength and resilience in your character\u2014than about what happened to you.\n\n\u201cYou are not a victim, you are a victory. Remember\u2014 you\u2019ve made it through 100% of your bad days. You made it this far, you can keep going.\u201d",

The fault and blame is only with the person who committed this crime.\u201d\n\nStevie Croisant is a writer, leader, proud dog-mom, and survivor of an abusive relationship. She lived through two years of intimate partner violence, also referred to as domestic violence, before being able to leave the relationship with the help of friends and family.\n\n\u201cEven though I knew deep down that I should leave, anyone who told me that too directly would become the enemy. Especially if my partner and I were doing okay in that moment. He made me feel like they just didn\u2019t understand what we had.\u201d\n\nSome of Stevie\u2019s friends had helped her recognize the abuse in a way that did not make her feel she had to distance herself from them. \u201cThey would drop hints, draw out details from me. If I told them about abuse that happened, they would ask me how I felt, instead of telling me I should feel bad about it. This helped me start realizing for myself that the things he was doing were wrong. I cannot thank my friends enough who stayed with me the whole time, through leaving him and after.\u201d\n\nWhen Stevie got a job she was excited about, her partner began to belittle her and use emotional manipulation to try to make her believe she wasn\u2019t capable of succeeding in it. He even harassed her through calls and texts when she traveled for business. It was when she was no longer in his physical presence, that she decided she would leave the relationship.\n\n\u201cGetting distance from him helped me realize how damaging his actions were to me. I realized that I\u2019ve worked too hard and come too far to get where I am today, and I am not about to let him stop me from achieving my goals.\u201d\n\nTogether with her family and friends, she made a safety plan for how she would get out of the abusive relationship. She took a vacation day without telling her boyfriend and, with the help of her friends, moved everything out of their house while he was at work.\n\n\u201cWith the abuse I had endured, it felt like I was finally getting my voice back after being silenced for two years.\u201d  After leaving the abusive relationship, Stevie experienced flashbacks, nightmares, and feelings of depression and anxiety. \u201cWhat affected me most were the nightmares. After leaving my ex, I felt like I wasn\u2019t safe anywhere. I couldn't relax. It felt like there was a threat waiting around every corner.\u201d\n\nThough her family was supportive throughout the safety planning process and helping her leave the abusive relationship, she says that they have sometimes made her feel ashamed for having stayed in the relationship for so long and have not been fully supportive of some aspects of her healing process.\n\nStevie says that seeing a therapist has been extremely important in her healing process. Her therapist has helped her identify healthy coping strategies and grounding techniques, such as breathing exercises and checking in with her senses. \u201cLearning grounding techniques has been super important for me. Setting healthy boundaries and realizing what I\u2019m worth has been crucial, too.\u201d\n\nWhen Stevie met with a group of five other survivors, it was the first time she\u2019d shared her story with anyone outside of her close friends and family. \u201cThey were the first people who truly were able to understand what I\u2019d gone through and listened to me without judgement. I cried in the shower after because of the incredible release of negative energy I felt.\u201d\n\nIt took Stevie a while to consider herself a survivor of intimate partner violence. \u201cI had heard about domestic violence from PSAs that left an image in my head that to be a domestic violence survivor you had to have obvious signs of physical abuse, like a black eye. So I never considered that what I endured could be an abusive relationship. It\u2019s really important to educate people about of all the forms of domestic violence so that we don\u2019t have this one image of what it looks like. Just because I don\u2019t fit the stereotype of what a domestic violence survivor looks like doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not one.\u201d\n\nSix months after leaving the relationship, Stevie started a blog where she and other survivors could share their stories. She started by inviting friends of hers who were survivors to write about their experiences, then others began contacting her, hoping also to share their stories. The blog grew into a podcast and eventually, into a nonprofit. The organization, WeAreHer.net, focuses on story-sharing, community building, and education efforts.\n\n\u201cIt was important to share my story through writing because I\u2019ve always been a writer, and that\u2019s something he took away from me. He would always make fun of my writing. When we were together, he wouldn\u2019t even let me write in my journal. When I started writing again, it felt so freeing. It made me feel like I had control over my narrative and was able to speak my truth.\u201d\n\nStevie is passionate about prevention education, especially for young people. She emphasizes how vital it is to teach kids and teens about healthy friendships, setting boundaries, appropriate touch, and other topics that help them grow into adults who engage in healthy, intimate relationships.\n\n\u201cConnecting with other survivors has been incredibly valuable. It made me feel that I wasn\u2019t alone, that I wasn\u2019t the only person who had been through this, and that I wasn\u2019t crazy.\u201d",

      "content": "Tarhata Brazsal experienced rape and intimate partner violence from her high school boyfriend. After the relationship ended, Tarhata told her sister and cousin about what had happened.\n\n\u201cI believed this was a normal thing that happened in relationships. The environment I was raised in catered to what boys and men wanted. I was used to living in a cultural and social perspective of masculine dominance with women being quiet and obedient.\u201d\n\nThough she is glad she disclosed the abuse, Tarhata says speaking about it brought up many difficult emotions. \u201cThere were a lot of after-effects. The rapes kept coming into my mind like a broken record. I could not function. It felt like the PTSD, shaking, anxiety, paranoia, anorexia, and suicidal thoughts had completely taken over my life.\u201d\n\n\n\nSome of the people Tarhata trusted most blamed her for what happened, insulted her, and made her feel ashamed for telling the truth of what happened to her. Many of them knew the perpetrator and chose to believe his side of the story. \u201cNo one wants to believe that a person they know and believe is a \u2018good guy,\u2019 would do something like this.\u201d After getting through that difficult period, she found herself surrounded by the people who had stood by her and supported her. \u201cAfter years, I eventually found people who were healthy and safe. I found out who my real friends and family were, and I let the others go.\u201d\n\nSeveral months after telling her sister, she told a close friend of hers who reacted in a supportive way. Her friend told her that it may be helpful to share her story with others. \u201cI owe everything to that friend. He wanted to hear my story and told me that others wanted to hear it, too.\u201d The next day she found herself in her friend\u2019s former high school, prepared to share her story in front of a group of students. \u201cI started telling my story and soon realized that absolutely no one was paying attention. None of them were taking me seriously. I got angrier and angrier. I was so mad that nobody was listening; I just wanted to be heard. Fifteen minutes in, I remember banging my fist on the desk, yelling at them. That\u2019s when they started listening.\u201d\n\nTarhata was worried that she had acted inappropriately, so she was surprised the next day to find messages on her phone of love, support, and gratitude for telling her story. Because of hearing Tarhata\u2019s story, several of the students had gone to the school counselor to discuss their own experiences of sexual violence for the first time. \u201cThat\u2019s when I found my voice\u2014and I\u2019ve been sharing my story ever since.\u201d\n\nTarhata has blended her career as a nurse with her mission of sharing her story and advocating for other survivors by becoming a sexual assault forensic nurse examiner. She finds immense fulfillment and purpose in doing everything she can to create a trauma-informed, patient-focused experience for those under her care. \u201cWhen I\u2019m called into a case, I am totally about the patient. I look at them through a lens of amazement at how strong they are and how much wisdom they have,\u201d Tarhata says. \u201cAt the end of every interaction I let them know how much I admire them to sit there with me and go through an entire exam after having been through such a traumatic experience. My patients are some of the strongest people I know. They are definitely not alone. I do my best to tell them this and honor their strength.\u201d\n\nTo best support survivors, Tarhata says, we should just listen. \u201cListen and let survivors speak their truth. It seems simple, but it takes a lot of patience, introspection, and selflessness.\u201d She emphasizes that it is important not to ask survivors details of their experience, rather to let them tell their story in whatever way they choose and at whatever time they choose. \u201cOffer yourself to be part of their healing process but do it on their timeline.\u201d\n\nTarhata knows from her own experience that patient and non-judgemental listening can be truly healing. Her sister has been her biggest advocate, listener, and supporter throughout her healing process. After learning of the sexual assault, Tarhata\u2019s sister did not pressure her to go to the police, but instead she listened and waited for Tarhata to feel ready to report it. \u201cShe didn\u2019t make me do anything I didn\u2019t want to do. She waited until I was ready. She gave me the power of choice. Everyone was trying to make me do what they thought would help me. People were trying to force me to act in a certain way, but my sister didn\u2019t. Because of that, she truly gave me my voice back.\u201d In addition to going with her to all of her medical appointments and counseling sessions, her sister would also help her continue eating even when Tarhata felt like she couldn\u2019t. \u201cI was too paranoid to do the simplest things like going to the grocery store. My sister would often come by and give me food, knowing that I had absolutely nothing in the fridge.\u201d\n\nTarhata remembers one incident in particular in which her sister\u2019s support saved her life when she was experiencing a period of depression and suicidal thoughts. \u201cI was driving over the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, and I wanted to drive myself off the overpass. I turned the wheel and was about to do it. But then I thought about my sister and how she listened to me, and I decided not to go through with it,\u201d says Tarhata. \u201cShe may not have been there, but she saved my life.\u201d\n\nAnother important aspect of Tarhata\u2019s healing has been finding the strength to spend time outside again. \u201cI had been indoors for so long and hadn\u2019t been eating, so I was really pale and my cheeks were sunken in. I felt so ashamed, and I was paranoid about people seeing me.\u201d She started by going on walks around the park, and when she got her rescue dog, Bonkers, he motivated her to continue spending time outdoors. \u201cMy dog was everything to me. When I was scared to go outside, he would walk with me. When I didn\u2019t eat, he would eat with me. Everything that made me feel uneasy, he would be the one to keep me calm. Bonkers came to all of my speaking events\u2014everyone knew him. It\u2019s funny how a little rescue dog can rescue you.\u201d\n\nA few years later when Tarhata\u2019s friends started having children and she and her husband had their son, she realized there was a lack of engaging and appropriate children books about healthy touch and relationships. She also found that the books that did exist did not feature any characters of color, something that had been a barrier for her seeing herself in characters in children's books when she was growing up and did not want her son to struggle with.\n\nShe decided to talk to parents and teachers about where students were learning about healthy touch and relationships. Students said they wished they learned more about this. There was a gap between teachers who thought that parents would talk to their children at home, and parents who thought teachers would educate students on the topics at school. Tarhata decided to do something about this\u2014she conducted research and wrote her master\u2019s thesis on a nurse-led program for elementary school students on healthy bodies and relationships. She then wrote an illustrated children\u2019s book that will soon also be available in Spanish and Tagalog.\n\nShe recommends to parents that they reframe consent in child-friendly language and start talking about it early. \u201cConsent is needed in every social setting. For kids, consent can be about sharing crayons with a classmate. I also like to use the concept of \u2018red light, green light\u2019 to talk about consent.\u201d She says that some people resist talking to kids about these topics because they do not discuss sex yet, but Tarhata says it\u2019s about learning respect, boundaries, and appropriate touch\u2014which can be discussed at any age and applied to many topics.\n\n\u201cWhat is motivating me right now is that I am a mother. Everything that I am doing is not just for me or other adults, it\u2019s because I want my son to be a good human being. This is my way of passing on leadership to the next generation and giving them the tools they need. The spotlight is now on them, and I\u2019m excited for their future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s my call to action? It\u2019s for individuals and our society as a whole to be open and talk about this. Discussing sexual assault used to be so taboo. As a society, we are healing together.\u201d",

      "content": "Hi, my name's Michelle, and I'm going to tell you my story about how I overcame an abusive relationship. I'm originally from South Jersey. I was in high school during like the 2008 market crash. Once finances kind of just became tight for literally the entire country, I kind of realized that college was going to be a tough expense. So I started looking into the military. So sure enough, I landed myself in the recruiter's office at the ripe age of 17, signed that paperwork, and I was at boot camp, I think, five days after my senior year graduation. The Marine Corps was a very interesting experience, and the military service across the board, I think, for women overall and generally speaking, can be a different level of challenge. I struggled physically a lot, and emotionally, the Marine Corps, I don't think, was probably the best pick because I had some less than ideal experiences, but my specific MOS or job was wonderful because it was public relations. I thought that I was going to basically spend my life in the Marine Corps, but I ended up getting pregnant with my daughter, and I didn't like the idea of raising a young baby in the military. So I made the decision to get out, but I was able to transfer my skills that I learned in the military, and I ended up taking the photography skill and turning that into my full-time career now. So I've been doing that for I'm going to live that photographer mom life in Southern California. I was 22, so, ripe, and so during that time, I had also started to really get into fitness. The gym that I started going to has where I met my ex. He worked there, America's Global And Intell Tw Olympic\u3060. active place She pursued me heavily, you ask for my number from someone at the gym, and it was very friendly. At work, food and dress were my go. I went to so many places, Antioch and overcrowding was primera cara. All I wanted was a \u0432 So I wasn't actively dating. very friendly at first and he seemed very low-key and non-threatening so we met at the gym we started hanging out um a little bit but he just would not give up so he was texting me all the time pursuing me all the time always asking me to hang out he he very quickly jumped right into the i love you's the i want to be with you forever you're you're perfect for me true love bombing straight from the beginning and he encouraged um you know moving in together and made these really grand promises so i'm a young single mom in southern california struggling to stay on my feet and so he proposed an option his family had a family business in north carolina and um you know they were willing to open up an additional store front for him to own and operate and run and manage and that i could come you know work with them and be a part of their basically family business somehow i fell for that but in my head it made sense i was like okay the schools are good and it's family oriented and i have a job and he said he'll you know pay for the rent and you know help support and blah blah blah and so we did it and we moved across the country i think very quickly when we arrived in north carolina things started to feel a little funny the promises that he made me immediately started to fall through so the family business was not ready so i couldn't come work there so now i'm home with a baby and i don't have a job and i left all of my clients behind in california so i don't have any new clients and it's not easy to just go find all of these things and make it happen so now i'm basically stuck at home with my small child who's you know she was 18 months at the time and i'm like i'm gonna go to work and i'm gonna go to work and i'm gonna go to work and i'm gonna go to work and and so i did very quickly start to feel stuck and he would kind of like blame me for making the decision he would say like you didn't have to come with me i was going to do it anyway and that was like the first instance of like the gas lighting that i noticed it was like you didn't tell me you were gonna do this anyway you said you were doing this for me like for us so that we can build this together and he would say well no i didn't so now i'm over here like did i misunderstand what he was saying as my career started to take off and i was getting you know better clients he would say little things like you know oh you don't know how to do the business side of things or oh you're not making enough money or if i did make money he would ask for that money and say like oh well you didn't contribute on rent his financial situation was always very secretive and any opportunity he could find to make me pay or convince me that i had to pay or ask me to pay for things or you know i'm not sure what to do with my money but i would say like you know i'm not sure how to do with my money and he would say well you know i'm not sure how to do with my money or come up with an excuse on why he couldn't pay he would always capitalize that on that and he made a significant amount way more money than i did and so it was just this really confusing dynamic you know at this point we had been together for over a year and i'm asking like hey what's the next step in this relationship like i'm trying to work do you want me to come work at the store like what we originally talked about and that's when he started giving me these like weird push backs like these parables of like well you know just show up or you know like you know like you know like oh i can't watch abby but then all of a sudden he could watch abby if i'm working at the store but not if i have a photography session so i start trying to seek out like babysitters and people who can watch my my child while i'm working and then he would come back and tell me like oh well they can't watch abby i don't trust them or do you even know that person they're not even your friends so every time i would try to like make a new connection he would tell me that that person isn't trustworthy and so i don't really trust myself at this point because he's been telling me every person i'm bringing into our lives is not a good fit for us my ex was just a heavy heavy heavy user in california obviously that's not really a bad thing even back in 2009 it was legal and then naturally too like if you're you are the company that you keep so he would sort of tell me like you should try it doesn't do to me what it does for other people i get like next level paranoid and not a paranoid like oh my gosh people are watching me it's like um my thoughts just go spiral so he would encourage me to a lot once he got me to like start to open up about like those traumas he would like strategically place these conversations in small increments throughout the day and then like 12 hours later would bring up a very small portion of the conversation and then i would elaborate and he'd be like we never talked about that before maybe i did just have that thought maybe i didn't say it and then he would do this same thing but in the reverse and be like i knew you were thinking that i just read your mind and then he started to say things like oh i was actually abducted by aliens and these like really strange elaborate stories and he'd be like i think i actually have these telepathic abilities to be able to communicate to people through their mind and then he would tell me like the next day when we're not like we didn't even have that conversation what are you talking about and then he started to tell me that i was falling into deep depression it was shortly after that i told my mom that i didn't want to be in this relationship something felt weird and i said i don't think i'm happy in this relationship i don't feel quite right i think i want to come home like i think i want to go like live with my parents and my mom was just like what do you mean you're doing great down there everything seems fine like he's nice hearing from like you know my mom who's been supportive of me like my whole life tell me that like everything looks really great from the outside made me think inside i'm like okay it's probably just me i went home that day and i poured my guts out to him and i said like you know i'm not happy you know and something's just not right here like i you know what do you want from me and that's when he completely flipped the script he's like i'd go to work every day for you this is why i'm here i work for you and so i immediately fell right into that and i'm like wow i'm an idiot one of the main red flags for me was he would wake me up in the middle of the night like 2 a.m 3 a.m 4 a.m and just have his way with me and i'll tell him to get off of me and then he'll just kind of like you know try to like seduce me into it and then you know i'm half asleep like at 7 o'clock at night so he's like no you know he's not happy with me At that point, I'm just like, all right, just like get whatever, just get it over with. You know, I don't care if you've been married 50 years. You can't consent while you're asleep. And I said, no, I said, stop. And you still just try to like keep going with it. And he'd be like, Michelle, I see you as my wife. Like, I'm going to be with you forever. You need to see it that way. Like we share the bed together. That's part of sharing the bed. I just wasn't strong enough in myself to stand up and be like, absolutely not. I didn't say yes. And it was that night after that conversation that I was crying in the bed. And I was still processing all the things that he said to me. Then he came in and very much forced himself on me. And I verbally said no, but he would not take no for an answer. And that. That's when everything really started to change. That's when like the gaslighting turned on to like the next level. So I fell into like an actual depression after that. I couldn't sleep for a couple of days. And he noticed. And so then he would start to wake me up in the middle of the night. And say, why'd you leave that light on? And I would say, what light? And he'd be like, I didn't turn the light in the closet on. And he would get up. Flick it on. And be like, it's on. Why'd you turn the light on? And I know that sounds so crazy. But when you are sleep deprived and depressed. And I'm like, your brain just like the brain chemistry is changing. You shove sexual assault on top of that. An abusive relationship where, you know, they're screaming at you every day. And so at this point, he's getting mad at me regularly. He started punching holes in walls. If I ever tried to argue back, there were a couple times where he would just like shove me into the wall. And then, you know, our sexual intimacy started getting really, really aggressive where he would grab me and hold me by my neck. And, you know, just continue to like to force it on me. I started losing a lot of weight. And I was definitely just like talking about needing to like spiritually cleanse myself. And I said that I was like, I think I'm gonna die. I think I'm hearing things from from above. Like, you know, something's going on. That's when, you know, he took it upon himself to say, like, oh, I'm really concerned about her mental health. And so then my parents were just like, oh, obviously, we trust your opinion. Like, you spend the most time with her. He started like calling my mom regularly saying, like, Michelle hasn't slept. She's not sleeping at all. I don't know what's going on. I think she's hearing voices. And then when he started telling my mom that he's sleeping. I was like, what's going on? I don't know what's going on. He thought I was hearing voices. He started saying to me, Michelle, I know you're hearing voices. I know you are. I know that you are. But you're too smart to admit that you're hearing voices. And when you're sleep deprived and you've been told that you're crazy and add on to that, whatever. He says you need to go see a doctor. But then in the same breath, he's like, but you can't you can't go to the psychologist because they might take Abby away. So don't worry. It's fine. You're fine, Michelle. But I know you're hearing voices. In the summer of 2016, it got so bad that I literally ended up in the hospital. You know, they told him at the time that I might be bipolar. And so he really latched on to that diagnosis. So we broke up for a short period of time after the hospital. I went and lived with my parents for a little while. Then he came back and visited us in New Jersey and encouraged me to, like, come home. He was like, oh, I miss you. Come back. You know, the love bombing phase, whole thing. So I moved back to North Carolina and very shortly after that, I got pregnant. So I got pregnant with my son, who's now almost five. So this is about five years ago. And we had a quiet-ish year. It wasn't easy. But it, you know, obviously I no longer it off. So he couldn't trap me in my spirals. So I've been seeking out some therapy, you know, through after I had my son. And our relationship was just very rocky. And it got to that point when my son was about one where I was like, oh, you know, like, are we going to get married? Like, what's the next step in our relationship? I was building up my business again. I was doing well. So he proposed in December of 2019. And so we were excited. And I was excited. Something still felt a little weird. Something felt off. Then 2020 hit. And we all know what happened in 2020. So our wedding plans got put very quickly. And we were very much on hold with 2020. And we are obviously we're all forced to be in the house together. So that's when, like, the abuse, like, really started to ramp up again. For a long time, I just convinced myself, like, oh, this is just part of life. This is just part of life. This is part of life. But at some point, enough is literally enough. So I got my own house. And I decided, I was like, I'm moving out. I'm doing it. Hired movers. I moved a couple miles up the street. I let him know the night before. I was like, I'm moving out. I'm going to do it. And he was like, OK, great. We're going to be great co-parents. About a week goes by. And then he started asking every day. And then it would be like, I'm picking Cooper up at 5. I'm like, oh, well, we've got plans. Like, we're going XYZ. Like, I'll bring him to you after. And he'd be like, no, no, no. Like, I'm right around the corner. I'm getting him now. Like, no, no, no. Like, we have plans. He said, Michelle, you're making this so complicated. Why do you have to make it so complicated? You're not letting me see my son. So this was like two weeks of this, where he's just randomly asking, changing plans at the last minute. So on my birthday, a couple months prior to this, he threw my phone, slammed it, smashed it. So then my birthday present was a new phone, you know, naturally. I need my phone back. And I'm like, no, this is my property. And so I put my phone in my bra. You know, that's like what girls do. I'm like, no, I'm leaving. I'm done with this conversation. That's it. And so this is when it starts getting like really physically aggressive. So he comes at me. Bear hugs me. He throws me on the ground. He's trying to like rip my hands apart. He rips my pants. He's like trying to pull me apart. He's not letting go. I'm able to like kind of just finagle my way out. And I just dart out the garage. Thank God my neighbor was outside mowing the lawn. And I'm all disheveled. I got bruises on me, red marks. My pants are ripped. So he calls 911. He ends up getting arrested. Spends a couple nights in jail. Court happens. He manages to like talk to his family, whatever. His family's like, you need to drop this. You need to let this go. And he's like, Michelle, I didn't touch you. You fell to the ground. So he manages to like love bomb the crap out of me and convince me that I escalated the situation. The state's pursuing him either way. So it don't matter. So he ends up getting convicted of, you know, domestic. It's like a misdemeanor or whatever. We end up working on it. We kind of got back together. Unfortunately, now we're into 2022. So he's really ramping it up. But now he's like, I'm going to go to jail. I'm going to go to jail. I'm going to go to jail. I'm going to go to jail. I'm going to go to jail. I'm going to go to jail. I'm going to go to jail. So this has been the last year of our relationship where he's just constantly saying, I'm over it. I want to leave this relationship. I don't want to be with you. I don't want to be with you. You don't do enough. It's never enough. It's never enough. It's never enough. So I'm the sole provider for my kids. Like I pay for everything. So I've been successful enough. My business to, to be able to like afford to live. Only thing he's paying for is the rent of the house. Everything else is in my name. Now he's telling me I need to leave and get out of his house and I need to get out of the house. And I'm like, no, like me and the kids live here. All of our things are here. Everything in this house is mine. You need to leave. So obviously he's like, no, it's my house. You got to get out. Whatever. So that goes on for like months. I'm just like, I need to find my. I need to get right with God. I need to be right with Jesus. So I finally get to this point in this relationship with him where I'm like, we're not having sex with each other. We need to be married. Our wedding never happened in 2020. If you don't like it, you can leave. And I believe that a lot of our issues stem from this for me. He agreed. Right. And we were pursuing couples therapy. And so we two weeks go by, he's getting itchy, you know, of course, and he decides to revert back to his old ways. So I'm like, I'm not going to let that go. I'm like, I'm going to leave. I don't want to go back to this. I'm going to leave this place and forcefully take it while I'm sleeping. And so I wake up in the middle of this happening. And I'm crying because at this point I've been asking for, for Jesus's guidance for help, for like, I want to cleanse myself and he just stole that from me. he woke up profusely apologizing. I'm broken all over. I was sexually assaulted in the military. So this is. All of this. triggering for me. So he comes to the house and he says, you can't come home. You cannot come to my house. You can't come back to my house. You're already gone. Stay gone. At this point now, he threatens my life and says, all hell will break loose, Michelle, if you step foot in that house. Do not come back to that house. And this is like a heated argument. I took those threats very seriously. He's not on the birth certificate of our son. I have full legal rights at this point. And so I told him the next day, okay, I'm not coming back. And he's like, okay, good. Within a week, I left and I was gone. And I said, peace out, beach town. And I'm starting my new life. About two weeks later, he files for emergency custody of our son and gets granted based on me being a flight risk, saying that he believed I was going to leave the state and that my bipolar was acting up. Seven years ago, he's bringing this back up. And my son, who I've never been away from for more than 24 hours, was ripped from my arms for two months. Refused to let me talk to him and refused to let me see him. But thankfully, when we finally got our court date, the judge saw through it and realized that they didn't have a case and that he, in fact, was the abuser. I was very happy to see my son back. I was very happy to see him back. I was very happy to see him back. That doesn't mean it's over. All of my friends and family that I have, and I'm now making new friends where I'm at, are very happy to see me pick up the pieces and start over. I'm starting to shoot more photography and find new clients in my new area. And I got a new job. My daughter's a competitive gymnast. My son's in the program that I work at. We're just very happy to be in a room where we can be together. And I'm very happy to be in a room where we can be together. We're just very happy to be in a room where we can be together. And I'm very happy to be in a room where we can be together. And I'm very happy to be in a room where we can be together. And I'm very refreshed version of our lives that we can really call our own and be completely separated from what we were setting up before. My advice for people who are experiencing any level of abuse, just advocate for yourself. Stand up for yourself in the moment, draw a boundary immediately, and follow through in the beginning. Every once they know they can challenge your boundaries, that's where your weakness is. And also, tell your story. There was a long time that I didn't tell my story to my family and my parents. And that ended up biting me because they believed the other person's story. Thank you so much for listening to my story. I hope that it inspires others to leave if they're ready to leave. Love yourself above all else and put yourself first and continue to push through and know that you're not alone. And there's always somebody there to support you. And if you need support, please feel free to reach out to me. I'm so grateful to have you reach out. You can find my links below if you need somebody and also if you want to follow my life or my photography from here.",

texting me all the time pursuing me all the time always asking me to hang out he he very quickly jumped right into the i love you's the i want to be with you forever you're you're perfect for me true love bombing straight from the beginning and he encouraged um you know moving in together and made these really grand promises so i'm a young single mom in southern california struggling to stay on my feet and so he proposed an option his family had a family business in north carolina and um you know they were willing to open up an additional store front for him to own and operate and run and manage and that i could come you know work with them and be a part of their basically family business somehow i fell for that but in my head it made sense i was like okay the schools are good and it's family oriented and i have a job and he said he'll you know pay for the rent and you know help support and blah blah blah and so we did it and we moved across the country i think very quickly when we arrived in north carolina things started to feel a little funny the promises that he made me immediately started to fall through so the family business was not ready so i couldn't come work there so now i'm home with a baby and i don't have a job and i left all of my clients behind in california so i don't have any new clients and it's not easy to just go find all of these things and make it happen so now i'm basically stuck at home with my small child who's you know she was 18 months at the time and i'm like i'm gonna go to work and i'm gonna go to work and i'm gonna go to work and i'm gonna go to work and and so i did very quickly start to feel stuck and he would kind of like blame me for making the decision he would say like you didn't have to come with me i was going to do it anyway and that was like the first instance of like the gas lighting that i noticed it was like you didn't tell me you were gonna do this anyway you said you were doing this for me like for us so that we can build this together and he would say well no i didn't so now i'm over here like did i misunderstand what he was saying as my career started to take off and i was getting you know better clients he would say little things like you know oh you don't know how to do the business side of things or oh you're not making enough money or if i did make money he would ask for that money and say like oh well you didn't contribute on rent his financial situation was always very secretive and any opportunity he could find to make me pay or convince me that i had to pay or ask me to pay for things or you know i'm not sure what to do with my money but i would say like you know i'm not sure how to do with my money and he would say well you know i'm not sure how to do with my money or come up with an excuse on why he couldn't pay he would always capitalize that on that and he made a significant amount way more money than i did and so it was just this really confusing dynamic you know at this point we had been together for over a year and i'm asking like hey what's the next step in this relationship like i'm trying to work do you want me to come work at the store like what we originally talked about and that's when he started giving me these like weird push backs like these parables of like well you know just show up or you know like you know like you know like oh i can't watch abby but then all of a sudden he could watch abby if i'm working at the store but not if i have a photography session so i start trying to seek out like babysitters and people who can watch my my child while i'm working and then he would come back and tell me like oh well they can't watch abby i don't trust them or do you even know that person they're not even your friends so every time i would try to like make a new connection he would tell me that that person isn't trustworthy and so i don't really trust myself at this point because he's been telling me every person i'm bringing into our lives is not a good fit for us my ex was just a heavy heavy heavy user in california obviously that's not really a bad thing even back in 2009 it was legal and then naturally too like if you're you are the company that you keep so he would sort of tell me like you should try it doesn't do to me what it does for other people i get like next level paranoid and not a paranoid like oh my gosh people are watching me it's like um my thoughts just go spiral so he would encourage me to a lot once he got me to like start to open up about like those traumas he would like strategically place these conversations in small increments throughout the day and then like 12 hours later would bring up a very small portion of the conversation and then i would elaborate and he'd be like we never talked about that before maybe i did just have that thought maybe i didn't say it and then he would do this same thing but in the reverse and be like i knew you were thinking that i just read your mind and then he started to say things like oh i was actually abducted by aliens and these like really strange elaborate stories and he'd be like i think i actually have these telepathic abilities to be able to communicate to people through their mind and then he would tell me like the next day when we're not like we didn't even have that conversation what are you talking about and then he started to tell me that i was falling into deep depression it was shortly after that i told my mom that i didn't want to be in this relationship something felt weird and i said i don't think i'm happy in this relationship i don't feel quite right i think i want to come home like i think i want to go like live with my parents and my mom was just like what do you mean you're doing great down there everything seems fine like he's nice hearing from like you know my mom who's been supportive of me like my whole life tell me that like everything looks really great from the outside made me think inside i'm like okay it's probably just me i went home that day and i poured my guts out to him and i said like you know i'm not happy you know and something's just not right here like i you know what do you want from me and that's when he completely flipped the script he's like i'd go to work every day for you this is why i'm here i work for you and so i immediately fell right into that and i'm like wow i'm an idiot one of the main red flags for me was he would wake me up in the middle of the night like 2 a",

for anybody who just doesn't want to hear about um physical abuse um I would just skip out on this video like obviously this is a very like like I said personal topic that I'm bringing up um the reason I decided to  film this was because I just kind of felt like I felt silenced like if like if like if I felt guilty that I went through something you know what I mean if that if that makes sense like that like I just didn't want to feel like it was my fault and I also wanted to come on here and like let other women or men  know that are going or have gone through this that it gets better and I just wanted to share my my story I guess let's get into what really H did happen whatever so I was um in a relationship for about 3 years I would say like officially it was like a year and a half and unofficially um I was with this person for another year and a half I would say um and in the beginning everything was fine I was 15 when I got in this relationship and they were older than me which now looking back at it I think is a little bit weird they were 18 when I was 15 but um you know whatever  not until like after we had broken up  did this person start to act different with me um and like I got cheated on  and Lord knows with how many people I got cheated on or whatever they did you know but um you know 16year old me is like oh my God this is the love of my life like I have to fix things with this person so what do I do I decide I want to give this person another chance and when I do this I don't know what it was but they like were always angry and they would throw that anger onto me he would just like emotionally abuse me on purpose as well like like he wanted to make me feel bad and again um I don't I didn't mention this but I was dealing with a narcissist um there's no other way I can describe this kind of person like and it just sucked because me I'm such a loving person and like honestly I'm very genuine and everything so when I saw this person start to become different with me I was very like like what is going on you know like it's took me out of my how do you say  like like I was like what do you mean like this person that said they love me is now treating me badly you know and things just started to get worse and I think the first time I ever experienced something with him um I think we're going to it was because he didn't want to get back with me cuz I don't know if he wanted to keep talking to girls or what it was to be honest but I remember we went to get sushi and he got off I was in the car and I would cry every day because I I actually did genuinely love him and I careed about him I did and he gets back in and I I just can't stop crying and we're picking up sushi for like us and my mom so my we were going to my house back to my house and my mom was downstairs like and when we would get there like she would see me that I was crying so he was just telling me like you need to clean yourself but the way uh like the way he would express it was not just like clean yourself it was like clean your [ __ ] self like a total different person I would say and I would be like what the [ __ ] like if somebody's talking to you like that you like I'm very emotional know as well so like if the person I love is talking to me like that like obviously I'm going to cry more so then what he proceeded to do was grab his jacket and like stuff it in my face he was driving the car he stuffs it in my face and he like clean your [ __ ] self again and then I was like what the [ __ ] like I can't stop crying like and you're being mean to me so like it's going to make me cry more you know like I was like just chill like if you're nice to me I'm not going to cry at least and then I don't remember what the [ __ ] happened but we're like almost to my house and I just remember him like pulling my hair and like making like pushing me towards the window so like I hit my window like on like my side or whatever and that was the first time he ever did something and you know I was like okay maybe that was just like a one time thing you know I used to say to myself like I don't know why women don't just leave when um when like they get abused I didn't understand why women didn't do that until like I sorry guys um I did get a little bit emotional but I didn't understand why women didn't leave um until I got in that situation and it was just so hard to like I I couldn't and I don't know if it was like a trauma Bond or what it was but I like physically couldn't leave like I would beg him to leave me uh because I just couldn't like physically I couldn't and I was so weak in that time like like mentally I was just not in an okay place I had pushed all my friends away for a relationship and I just had nobody the only person I felt like I had was him so I was like well like we like if it won't happen again whatever like you know and then it happened again it happened a few times um I won't go into like all of those details of every single time that it happened but that that was how it started I would just cry all the time and like I I just couldn't wrap my head around I think like I always have this like hope  that the person that I did love or that I thought I met and fell in love with would come back but then I realized this person like that person wasn't real that person never existed and I was holding on to something that I loved for so long and that's why I couldn't let go like I told them to leave me I asked him to leave me because I couldn't do it myself I was a 16-year-old girl or no I was 17 I was 17 at this time sorry I was a 17-year-old girl who didn't know what to do I couldn't leave I I felt lonely right so I told him I was like bro like and I was so serious about this too like and this is so like deep and personal but I wanted to just end my life because I just couldn't like it was to the point where I could not and I know I sound so dumb but at that point like I was obviously like I just felt like I had nobody I didn't know like like all my all I had was him basically so for some for all I had like to be treating me like that to be acting like I wasn't worth what I am worth was just like so hard on me and I was just so tired like I was crying every single day I felt like I wasn't enough and like on top of that like the person that you fell in love with changing on you like from one day to another when I would never do that it was just insane to me like and I know like some people think why don't you hit him back and like fight back whatever but it was like this fight or flight Instinct that told me like if I hit this man back I do something the possibility of him just like hitting me worse or beating me like even I would think about like on like he like this person can kill me on on accident you know what I mean like like they he get he get mad and you're not realizing what you're doing you're not paying attention to your actions you know accidents happen and like for you to especially when you're mad like you know so I was like I can't do any of that or else I might hurt worse I stayed and it wasn't like constant abuse [Music] obviously it being constant or not constant either weight is bad they shouldn't be abuse in any relationship I don't believe in that for a few months it wasn't there like at all like the physical abuse I guess you you could say but um emotionally he was  always and I mean always taking things out on me like this is just a narcissist like when I left this person person I remember clearly he said um he didn't want me to leave him but I had already been thinking about that for so long like I wanted to leave for so long and I just didn't cuz I was comfortable like I was just kind of scared for a new situation you know this is what I've known for for years and to leave was so hard but I knew I needed to do it and like I didn't want that anymore and I couldn't continue um so when I was leaving him he was telling me no like don't do it whatever um and he literally just told me he was like something about that I was fat like to try and bring me down I guess like a narcissist and then I I told him that doesn't hurt me anymore you know because I realized like At first I wanted to get back with him and I started working on myself and bettering myself and then I realized my worth when I was working on myself to try and get back for someone like I try to be better for him because he tried he manipulated me into thinking everything was my fault even though he was cheating on me I was like that's it's tarious like I don't know it's just like the audacity you know what I mean and then he started crying that he didn't want me to leave him or whatever and it's just so insane and crazy to me that people like this exist and are so evil I just want whoever is watching this video whoever's been through something like this um anyone who maybe to even avoid something like this to know that you're not alone and if you're going through this this right now I hope that you get out of it um because it is something that's bad you know like it's not healthy like you deserve love and you deserve somebody that wants to protect you and not hurt  you um especially in a relationship as much as you love somebody I want you to know that you need to love yourself more and staying with somebody that doesn't value or respect you and is capable of putting their hands on you does not love you and as much as you try and think oh maybe things will change they won't um and usually they get worse so I hope you if you are in that situation I hope you leave soon and I'm sending love to those who are in that situation cuz I know it's hard and to those who have been through it I'm sending love as well and I help you heal from all of those traumatic things or feelings you have from those sit from that situation I have a lot of things I feel like I need to fix still like my trust is very low now because of that because I trusted without a second thought and and what I got in return was a narcissist I guess I don't know if I know it sounds dumb saying as I I didn't do so I was young though um if that were to ever happen to you and you don't leave the first time they hit you they hurt you you need to to leave the first time even though you think they won't do it again they cross the boundary and that boundary is gone and they're not going to respect it no matter what you think how much you think you know this person once somebody crosses a boundary they're going to keep pushing to see how far they can go and you don't want to see how far they can go right so just keep that in mind I just felt like it was necessary for me to make this cuz it's been it's always been on my mind like a lot like sometimes it feels like it's not fair because I got stuck with all this pain and hurt for so  long and then it just feels like the other person is just fine and they get to live life like nothing when you know like you didn't hurt anybody and they hurt you so it kind of turns into anger but like I don't want to be angry I don't want to be hurt I don't want to feel like I don't want to feel like a victim I want to feel like I have power over this situation so I guess that's what I'm choosing to do is regain power I learned that I need to love myself and although I am not 100% there there's still so much growth I'm looking forward to doing for myself but I know I'm on  the right path and it takes time to heal from things you know what I mean but um I'm pushing towards that and I'm taking power my power back and I don't want to let that affect me any further my final advice as well if anybody that's gone through that don't let it control your life and dictate your life um you take your power back whatever that means to you and just Thrive literally that's all you can do um as hard as it is and I haven't gotten to that point you need to forgive people not for them clearly but for yourself so you can be at peace cuz  hate and anger are such like nasty emotions I hate to feel them um and they're not healthy for you so as hard as it can seem forgive for yourself is what I would say but I know  it takes time work towards it work towards yourself and yeah that's I think that's all I really need to say but thank you for listening to me and I appreciate everybody who's been there for me um especially like in social media to be honest I felt like when I was alone that was like the only thing I really had um so I want to thank anybody that's ever like like whoever's suppored me I know there's some people that have supported me for years and some people that know who I'm talking about in this video who supported me for years and continue to do so I appreciate all of you so much for helping me push through this as well as my friends and my family that's that's the end of this video um I usually say I hope you enjoyed it but like you know I don't really think that's adequate for this video um but anyways guys thank you for listening to me again I love you  guys and I'll see you guys soon",

          "content": "hey guys welcome back to my channel my name is Gracia um as you can tell by the title of today's video I am going to be talking about something very personal um  also trigger warning for anybody who just doesn't want to hear about um physical abuse um I would just skip out on this video like obviously this is a very like like I said personal topic that I'm bringing up um the reason I decided to  film this was because I just kind of felt like I felt silenced like if like if like if I felt guilty that I went through something you know what I mean if that if that makes sense like that like I just didn't want to feel like it was my fault and I also wanted to come on here and like let other women or men  know that are going or have gone through this that it gets better and I just wanted to share my my story I guess let's get into what really H did happen whatever so I was um in a relationship for about 3 years I would say like officially it was like a year and a half and unofficially um I was with this person for another year and a half I would say um and in the beginning everything was fine I was 15 when I got in this relationship and they were older than me which now looking back at it I think is a little bit weird they were 18 when I was 15 but um you know whatever  not until like after we had broken up  did this person start to act different with me um and like I got cheated on  and Lord knows with how many people I got cheated on or whatever they did you know but um you know 16year old me is like oh my God this is the love of my life like I have to fix things with this person so what do I do I decide I want to give this person another chance and when I do this I don't know what it was but they like were always angry and they would throw that anger onto me he would just like emotionally abuse me on purpose as well like like he wanted to make me feel bad and again um I don't I didn't mention this but I was dealing with a narcissist um there's no other way I can describe this kind of person like and it just sucked because me I'm such a loving person and like honestly I'm very genuine and everything so when I saw this person start to become different with me I was very like like what is going on you know like it's took me out of my how do you say  like like I was like what do you mean like this person that said they love me is now treating me badly you know and things just started to get worse and I think the first time I ever experienced something with him um I think we're going to it was because he didn't want to get back with me cuz I don't know if he wanted to keep talking to girls or what it was to be honest but I remember we went to get sushi and he got off I was in the car and I would cry every day because I I actually did genuinely love him and I careed about him I did and he gets back in and I I just can't stop crying and we're picking up sushi for like us and my mom so my we were going to my house back to my house and my mom was downstairs like and when we would get there like she would see me that I was crying so he was just telling me like you need to clean yourself but the way uh like the way he would express it was not just like clean yourself it was like clean your [ __ ] self like a total different person I would say and I would be like what the [ __ ] like if somebody's talking to you like that you like I'm very emotional know as well so like if the person I love is talking to me like that like obviously I'm going to cry more so then what he proceeded to do was grab

      "content": "Hi, my name is Sarah. Today you're going to hear my story of my experience with my ex-husband in my abusive relationship. I grew up in a traditional home. I was raised Pentecostal Christian, so it was very hierarchical. So my dad definitely was the man of the house. My dad was ex-military, so he suffered from bipolar disorder. So there was a lot of ups and downs within his personality. I am the youngest of three. We were a close family. I had good parental role models for a relationship. I didn't date very much. I watched my siblings really battle with my parents at a young age. So my brother and sister were kind of rebellious. And so at seven, eight years old, they're like screaming and yelling at each other. And I just knew I didn't want to be that way. So I pretty much did whatever my parents told me to do. And I really didn't date much till I got to college, which I think was part of the problem. I would kind of dream about who that person was for me. And obviously at that point in my life, it came from a religious standpoint. So I was like, I wonder who God has chosen for me. Because I truly believe that those relationships were chosen sort of. So I would think a lot about that. I definitely wanted to have kids. I knew I wanted to be a mom at a very young age, but I was kind of awkward and I was loud and I didn't have very good relationships with my peer groups. And I think that was where a lot of this stemmed from is I didn't have like in high school, I definitely wasn't a popular kid. I remember a guy in high school said to me, it's unfortunate that you're so pretty and so annoying. And I said, I'm not going to be that kind of person. I'm going to be a little bit more of an introvert. And I think that was kind of my biggest reason for not dating at that same time. And so, you know, just kind of like, wow, you know, lots of boys in school want to date you, but you're annoying. Kind of a thing was kind of the messaging that I got. Even like the one person that I did date in high school, he wouldn't talk to me in school, like we dated outside of school, because he was in a way different peer status than I was. And so we worked together and then he would really liked him. But then he started dating a cheerleader from a neighboring school at the same time. I have big feelings. I've always had big feelings. I get really attached really quickly. And so that has caused me to not have the best judgment because I tend to stay attached too long because the hurt of losing someone is greater than staying with them. I went to college. I immersed myself in college. I joined a sorority because I wanted to make friends. And then I took a semester off and I started to work at this local insurance company in my town doing customer service type stuff. And he worked there. We met that way. I didn't know he liked me. I had no idea. And then when I came back after going to London, we connected pretty strongly after that. Like he told me he liked me. I really wasn't sure. Then there was another girl at work who liked him. And then I was like, okay, maybe I really do like this person because there was this twinge of jealousy. Don't take him from me kind of experience. He went to the same college as me. And so I really felt like it was kind of meant to be because we went to the same college. We had similar lifestyles. Like he understood me. Like he never, ever while we were dating, ever made fun of me. He never talked down to me. We just sort of really hit it off really well. And so he was the first person that I really felt like understood me in a way that other people didn't. So I think that's where I was like, okay, this is easy. We got along. We had similar interests. We went to the same college. So we started dating. We had a lot of similar interests, but I immersed myself in college. I was like, okay, I'm going to go to college. I'm going to go to a lot of his interests that I didn't even know I liked. Like we would go fishing and we would go camping and we would do all these outdoor things that I really hadn't been exposed to that much. My mom didn't like those things. My dad took me to a dude ranch in Wyoming when I was in eighth grade, which I absolutely loved. So he let me explore like a side of myself that I didn't really get to do much when I was younger. I would describe it as easy. It was easy at first. We were dating for two years and then we got engaged and we were engaged for a year before we got married. So we were together. For a good solid three years in our twenties. And it was just that, that whole time, it was pretty easy. He was everything I wasn't. So it became this like very complimentary back and forth with, oh, I'll do, I could do the bills and you could do this part of it. And it felt very easy and connected. We did start living together about three months before we got married, which I don't even know how that was okay with my family, with how I was raised. I did start to see some difficulties with living with somebody. My parents reassured me, Hey, you know, you guys just started living together. You're going to have some disagreements about who picks up the socks and who cleans the bathroom and who, who does this and that within the relationship. Both my parents approved of the relationship. Everything was wonderful. And then we had this like dream honeymoon in Aruba on this like magical week, which I thought was going to be this perfect honeymoon. And that's where immediately I felt like he like flipped a switch. We got to Aruba and he, he obviously had some issues that I was not aware of. Immediately he pulled out the courting device at the time and wanted to videotape us being intimate on our honeymoon. And I was like, what are you doing? No, absolutely no way. Like I'm not comfortable with this, especially with my really strict religious background and growing up the way that I did. And this being a very sacred sort of thing with the way I was raised. And he did not like that. He did not like me telling him no, like at all. And that was really our first physical anything. Like he gave me a fat lip because I would not allow this to go on. He pulled my hair. I had a ponytail in and it was like all disheveled on the top. And I had a big fat lip. He ended up holding the back of my hair while he videotaped it and then didn't like it because I wasn't into it, I guess, or whatever. And so it turned into this big thing on our honeymoon and I'm sitting in Aruba and I'm completely blindsided. I'm like, what do I do? I can't just fly home. We just got married. Like we, we, we can't even unwrapped our wedding gifts yet really. Um, they were still all boxed up. And so I just sort of pushed it aside and enjoyed the rest. And if anybody was really paying attention, they could see my fat lip. And like he recorded the majority of our trip just for tourist type purposes. So every time I would see that I would see the big fat lip that I had, the big cut in my lip that I had. We had been intimate before we were married. So this wasn't like our first ever experience or anything. He had never expressed. Any sort of kinky was raised Catholic. Like I just assumed that we were just having a normal loving relationship. I wasn't aware of any sort of sexual addiction or anything like that at all. When we moved in together a little bit of control kind of stuff about living together. But again, I was reassured that that was normal. When you first start to live with somebody, you're going to have that period of time where it's a little bit Rocky. This was completely blindsided. I mean, I was completely and totally blindsided. I re remember I left the hotel room to get away. I was like, what do I do? I mean, it wasn't like a big city where I could go to the airport and find a flight home like they only flew on certain days of the week. I remember running into a hotel staff. And he's like, Are you okay? And I'm like, Yeah, I'm fine. But I must have looked a mess because he was at I'm bleeding from my mouth and my hair is all it was completely like a different person. Not at all like anything I had seen our relationship was completely very normal, very easy while we dated. And then it was like we got married and the flight switch just flipped. We talked about it at the time and then he just apologized. And we know how they do this profusely apologizing to me. Oh my gosh, I don't know what got what got into me. I'm so sorry. And I being the kind of the glass half full empathic person that I am. I was like, Oh, it's okay. Like, I'm sure I don't know what that was. We just got married. There's been a lot of stress for the planning the wedding. So I immediately started to downplay it even with things that he wasn't even telling me just like, Yeah, it was awesome. But it was like I got into \u0413\u043e\u0441 m\u00e9thic actually, and I would just say I didn't you know, we'd go out to dinner with him and we couldn't have any sort of\ufffd\ufffd our in life and concerts and ginger and pub Blow ball\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb or whatever I might not care about. Like, I should have a wage. I was like, your job is your job. That was \ub108\ubb34 difficult for me. And I became a realBig tried to give\ufffdr an excuse so that I could be used as a bonus at a party or at the other party in a group so that this experience would really be as different. But he did do it very quickly, just ascomfort. We could I don't know how much he'd try But oh, yeah, totally. Like went from you stood up to him being a good guy without ahead of the household i never knew what was going to set him off so i would keep this tally in my head of okay i can't do that because that set him off okay i can't do this this set him off it was never predictable i never knew what was going to make him angry so there there was this very classic cyclical pattern of abuse in our marriage that everybody that you know that revolving door of abuse and he even got smart he would hit me on the top of my head so that you i didn't have any marks on me at all like he would hit me in the head so that there weren't any bruises there weren't any marks i have really thick hair so he would pull me by my hair there wasn't any marks i didn't have to answer to anything i didn't say anything to anyone for a long time it went on for quite some time he is very charismatic so everybody loved him everyone thought like he was the golden boy of the three boys in his family my parents thought he was just the greatest thing and then we had kids and I started to kind of say things throughout having kids. I really did make excuses for him. I mean, we were this golden couple. We both had really amazing jobs. We had a very large home in our early 20s on three acres of land. I think there's a misconception about abuse, especially in like upper middle-class families. There's almost like more shame in it when you've reached a level of education and a level of success. It's almost harder to say something because you're supposed to be educated and you're not supposed to fall for this. I didn't say anything for quite some time. Like everything, it escalated. I did call the police on him a couple years after we were married and that's when I finally told my parents about it. He threw me out of the house in the middle of winter with no coat and told me to go away. And so I walked down to a gas station and I had to call the police to get help because I was freezing cold. So I did call the police. That's when my parents found out he was arrested. It was dismissed down to a disorderly conduct ticket because I was like, please don't do anything. I was the wife that was like, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. A lot of it started to revolve around the house cleaning. I tend to be more of a laxed person when it comes to the house. He is very OCD. Under gender roles, he wanted me to clean the house. That really wasn't my strong suit. So if the house wasn't exactly the way that he wanted it to be, that was a big point of contention in our relationship. It was a lot of hair pulling. It was a lot of dragging on the floor. It was a lot of punching me in the head, verbal abuse. There was a lot of sexual abuse where I didn't feel like doing anything, but he kind of, you know, that became clear on our honeymoon that that was just kind of the precedent that he was going to set. It definitely started to escalate to more and more severe as the episodes went on. I remember being in the car one time and he wanted me to do something and I said no. And he just like backhanded me and my head hit the side of the car window. And I like blacked out for a second and I had a huge black eye the next day and had to try to explain to people what happened. And, you know, we were camping and I was under the table and I looked up and I hit the pole of the table. Like I had to come up with something. He tried to toss me, but I was like a hundred pounds and I missed the bed and I hit the floor and I fractured a vertebrae in my neck and I had to make excuses about that. And, you know, that, oh, the dog leash got caught and I fell down the stairs when I was going down the stairs with the dog. I think that's when I started to notice that there was a big problem was when I was wearing a neck brace at 25 years old. I just got this overwhelming urge that I wanted to have kids. And then I got pregnant and then he was so upset because a couple of days before I found out I was pregnant, he had had an episode where he was abusive to me. And I remember coming home and telling them that I was pregnant and him feeling like so upset about the fact that I was pregnant and could he have hurt the baby? The safest I ever felt with him was when I was pregnant. And it was an empathy that I had not seen from him ever. Our marriage while I was pregnant was really like very calm. And if I would get upset, he would try to do whatever he could to diffuse my stress. I remember writing him a letter after I left him about how I felt jealous of our kids because I felt like he treated our kids way differently than he ever treated me. And he was kind and nice and gentle with them when they were little. And I remember saying, I shouldn't be jealous of my four-year-old. I had hoped and I thought that would continue after they were born because I'm like, oh, now we have kids. He's going to want to shelter them. He's going to want to protect them. He triangulated us a lot. So he would say, oh, mom's stupid or oh, mom is this or oh, mom's that. And then I remember one time with our, so my daughter's older and I remember one time my daughter was maybe two and they were sitting playing a game on the floor and I walked into the room and he said, tell mommy to go away. And she's like, mommy, go away. And I was like, okay, this is not going to happen. This is not okay. Like, I don't want my daughter growing up having to say mean things to her mom. He was verbally abusive in front of the kids. He also a couple of times would use the kids as pawns. Like my son was up in his crib and was calling for me. And my husband was like, you can't get him out of the crib until you clean the house better. And then there was the one time that I, what made me finally get out was he hit me in front of our daughter and she walked in the room and said, dad, what are you doing? And he's like, mommy deserves a spanking. It was like a flip of a switch for me. And I just was like, I cannot allow my children to be raised in this environment. Like I just, I can't, I can't. I called the police and just said, hey, my husband hit me. This is where I am. And then they came over, they took my statement and then they went back to the house. So I never told him I was leaving. And I think that was part of what saved me. I mean, there would have been no way for me to get out if I would have said I'm leaving. Not too long before this had happened, we were in a car accident. And I was like, we were away for a weekend. And he said to me, you know, if you ever leave me, they're going to find you at the bottom of a lake somewhere. And he just said it really subtly, like casually in a conversation. Like it wasn't part of a bigger conversation. He just said it. I put a 72 hour hold, like a no contact hold on it. I called my parents. They came over. Cause I'm like the minute he gets out, he's going to come here. And I don't trust him. He he's never been one to like boundaries. And then that's really when I, when I discovered the, the sexual cheating and the affairs that he was having and other things too, was that same weekend. So if the physical abuse wasn't going to cause me to leave the, the, the affair, what I almost feel like while we were dating, he was like studying me, my personality, my insecurities, my weaknesses. There was a part of me that found gratitude in my experiences, not necessarily gratitude in him, but gratitude for my experiences because I'm able to use them to help other people now. And it was that spiritual moment.",

telling  you guys a story time and that story  time is going to be about the time that  I was in an abusive relationship forgive  me if this is a hard topic to talk about  I chose this story because this month  will be the 2year anniversary of leaving  this relationship I am very proud of  myself for doing so and finally getting  out of it and the story is not to make  anyone feel sorry for me I'm not looking  for sympathy this story is to Simply get  my story out there and to raise  awareness on the topic of domestic  violence and the causes and the red  flags that you can look out for  basically to tell everyone out there  watching that may be in the same  situation that it's going to be okay  there are people there for you there's  always someone that you can talk to so  this story takes place about November of  2013 I was 16 years old and I had met  someone who was 3 years older than I was  he was already out of high school so  about 2 weeks after meeting we decided  to make it official and we started  dating we kind of moved very fast into  the relationship we said I love you  within the first month which I don't  know for me I know we didn't really love  each other but he said it first so I  felt like I had to say it back which I  think was one of our first problems but  for the first 2 months we never fought  at all it was honestly a really perfect  relationship and everything that I  thought I wanted he always wanted to  spend time with me and even even when we  weren't spending time together we were  always talking when we were just talking  he wanted to know where I was who I was  with and at the time I thought that that  meant that he really cared about me  around the 2month mark of our  relationship we ended up getting into  one of our first huge fights this fight  consisted of him making me choose  between him and my best friend at the  time me being the 16-year-old that I was  I chose him because I thought that he  was more important and he made me feel  really guilty if I didn't choose him he  would say things such as you'll never  find anyone like me who cares about you  and loves you like I do she's not really  a real friend she would want the best  for you he would say things that would  make my mind think that he was the only  person that would ever really care about  me he started to really emotionally  abuse me I guess but I didn't see it as  that I just kind of thought that he was  looking out for the best for me he would  say things like I should get a job and  that I was lazy for not having a job but  I was a junior in high school and all my  time was focused on school and sports he  would say things that would make me feel  even worse about myself like I have  hotter friends than you but I don't  choose them because I would rather be  with you like you have a better heart  but at the time I struggled really  deeply with body image and just a whole  General self-image about a month later  after a month or two later after that  one huge argument he started to act out  on his feelings of rage you would get in  fights more frequently most of our  fights happened to be when he was  driving and I was in the passenger seat  so most of the time he would punch the  center console or he would punch his  radio in his car he broke both of them  there's holes in his car he ended up  like he would show me holes in the wall  that he punched at his house expected me  to feel like like I should do like I  should just feel bad for him he clearly  had anger issues but I didn't want to  see that I was honestly starting to  become afraid of him because he would  get so like raged out he ended up  breaking things of mine as well he ended  up punching a hole through my bathroom  door one time he punched and broke a  lamp that was in my room and glass flew  everywhere I don't remember most of the  fights that we had because I chose to  forget about what had happened another  red flag that I should have seen before  was that he never wanted to really hang  out with my friends and I he would  always want to it just be me and him or  be me him and his friends but I didn't  really like his friends his friends were  kind of bad influences on him I remember  being in one fight with him and just  seeing like the anger in his eyes and  you could tell that he he was like one  of those people  where if you're angry then you kind of  like black out you don't really know  what you're doing or saying or anything  like that which is honestly really scary  I just remember looking him dead in the  eyes and like knowing that it wasn't him  that was really doing those things which  is one of the excuses I constantly made  up for him which is not fair to me or  anyone that I pushed away in this  relationship I ended up losing a lot of  my friends I would ditch them for him  because he made me feel so isolated  eventually I'm pretty sure my family  could sense that I was becoming a little  bit more different and distant because  he would always say things like that he  cares about me more than they do  although I knew that wasn't true I just  wanted to kind of have the sense of  belonging with him you just want to be  with them because without them it feels  almost impossible no matter how bad the  situation is a few months later and it  is summer at this point we had broken up  or like split up for a little bit but we  were still talking trying to work things  out but we knew we just couldn't have  that title and the pressure of a title  on us he ended up showing up to my house  and my house is like in the middle of  nowhere it's in the woods so if I were  to like scream like in horror there  would no one would be able to hear me  like no one could see what was going on  basically I'm going to name my  ex-boyfriend Daryl Daryl so he he had  basically heard from his best friend  that and I'm going to name his best  friend Tam so basically Tam had told  Daryl that we had hung out like without  his knowing and that I was trying to  like hook up with Tam obviously I wasn't  we didn't even hang out I don't know why  he would tell him that basically I hated  his best friend like his best friend was  manipul  man  manipulative he was just honestly a  really bad person so if you're watching  this sorry Daryl had showed up to my  house in the middle of nowhere and was  obviously filled with rage I had just  gotten out of the shower telling my  friend I heard I knew that he was angry  with me so I wasn't surprised when I  heard like a car on the gravel of my  driveway and I told my friend that I was  talking to Hey listen if I don't answer  you within 10 minutes please call the  cops and I sent him my address I think  as a 17-year-old I shouldn't have to  tell someone to call the cops if I don't  respond because of my ex-boyfriend being  a psycho I'm looking at my window and  he's literally on his knees crying but  that was his way of trying to make me  feel bad for him he wasn't being sincere  about it and I had no sympathy for him  at this time we were literally fighting  every single day up to this point he  basically went from crying and then he  stands up and his whole Persona just  changes he gets that look in his eyes it  was just like a flip switch it was scary  because it's like he didn't really know  who he was anymore I didn't know who he  was anymore I am texting my friend back  and then I'm even texting my dad  basically Daryl had asked me to go be up  Tam and that he has a baseball bat in  the car and he also has a long knife I'm  not sure what they're called it wasn't  like a kitchen knife it was like an  actual knife he had one of those in the  car and basically he's threatening Tam's  life which is his supposedly best friend  for me supposedly hook up with him in  which none of that was true so I'm  texting my dad and telling him like like  I want to leave the house because I  don't want to be in the middle of  nowhere but I don't want to ride with  him so I'm like offering like I'll take  my car you take yours my dad didn't want  me leaving the house which I understand  like perfectly so I didn't leave the  house I told Daryl that and basically  Daryl just keeps crying and then finally  I'm like on the phone I was either  recording what he was saying or I was  starting to type out 911 just in case so  that I can just hit send right there or  call I think he saw this so he snatches  my phone away from me and he was like a  few inches taller than me so if he was  holding my phone up above his head to  where I couldn't reach it at the same  time as he's grabbing my phone holding  it up with his other hand he is gripping  my arm so tight he was gra gripping my  left arm he was twisting it around he  continued to threaten to kill himself  which is not cool that's really  manipulative to make someone do what  they don't want to do is to threaten to  kill yourself he finally left but he  stormed off and he like almost like my  dad's driveway is kind of on a mountain  not really it's not an actual Mountain  but there's a big drop off like on  either either side of the driveway so he  stormed off and it almost looked like he  like fell over the edge but he didn't he  was fine but I was worried for his  safety like even though like he was  really manipulative and not a good  person I did care for him and I was  worried but after that day I texted my  grandma who was a LA and I told her that  I needed a restraining order against him  because I started to fear my own life  and my family's life because he had  threatened to kill people or like burn  my house down stuff like that and kill  me and that is just so like obsessive I  ended up getting a restraining order on  him shortly after that fight it was like  one of the best decisions I had ever  made yeah that's the story of the time  that I was in an abusive relationship if  you're watching this and you're like  you're in this situation like please  know that you're not alone like there  are so many people I remember searching  for apps and things that would help me  and resources of people who are in  abusive relationships and just being in  the room of where I got the restraining  order at not the courtroom but like the  step before the courtroom there were  people there and it was so like I got to  hear some stories like on the side  there's always people that you can talk  to I just hope that at least I can help  one person through making this video so  I hope you guys enjoyed this video and I  hope that you learned something from  this video if I can just help one person  like that would just make me feel so  good I'll see you guys in my next video",

what's up I'm Katie  Kier if you're new to my channel then  you should hit that subscribe button  because you'll get notified when I post  new videos and it's free so why not  today's video I'm going to be telling  you guys a story time and that story  time is going to be about the time that  I was in an abusive relationship forgive  me if this is a hard topic to talk about  I chose this story because this month  will be the 2year anniversary of leaving  this relationship I am very proud of  myself for doing so and finally getting  out of it and the story is not to make  anyone feel sorry for me I'm not looking  for sympathy this story is to Simply get  my story out there and to raise  awareness on the topic of domestic  violence and the causes and the red  flags that you can look out for  basically to tell everyone out there  watching that may be in the same  situation that it's going to be okay  there are people there for you there's  always someone that you can talk to so  this story takes place about November of  2013 I was 16 years old and I had met  someone who was 3 years older than I was  he was already out of high school so  about 2 weeks after meeting we decided  to make it official and we started  dating we kind of moved very fast into  the relationship we said I love you  within the first month which I don't  know for me I know we didn't really love  each other but he said it first so I  felt like I had to say it back which I  think was one of our first problems but  for the first 2 months we never fought  at all it was honestly a really perfect  relationship and everything that I  thought I wanted he always wanted to  spend time with me and even even when we  weren't spending time together we were  always talking when we were just talking  he wanted to know where I was who I was  with and at the time I thought that that  meant that he really cared about me  around the 2month mark of our  relationship we ended up getting into  one of our first huge fights this fight  consisted of him making me choose  between him and my best friend at the  time me being the 16-year-old that I was  I chose him because I thought that he  was more important and he made me feel  really guilty if I didn't choose him he  would say things such as you'll never  find anyone like me who cares about you  and loves you like I do she's not really  a real friend she would want the best  for you he would say things that would  make my mind think that he was the only  person that would ever really care about  me he started to really emotionally  abuse me I guess but I didn't see it as  that I just kind of thought that he was  looking out for the best for me he would  say things like I should get a job and  that I was lazy for not having a job but  I was a junior in high school and all my  time was focused on school and sports he  would say things that would make me feel  even worse about myself like I have  hotter friends than you but I don't  choose them because I would rather be  with you like you have a better heart  but at the time I struggled really  deeply with body image and just a whole  General self-image about a month later  after a month or two later after that  one huge argument he started to act out  on his feelings of rage you would get in  fights more frequently most of our  fights happened to be when he was  driving and I was in the passenger seat  so most of the time he would punch the  center console or he would punch his  radio in his car he broke both of them  there's holes in his car he ended up  like he would show me holes in the wall  that he punched at his house expected me  to feel like like I should do like I  should just feel bad for him he clearly  had anger issues but I didn't want to  see that I was honestly starting to  become afraid of him because he would  get so like raged out he ended up  breaking things of mine as well he ended  up punching a hole through my bathroom  door one time he

      "content": "hi danielle here welcome to danielle's  corner today i wanted to share a story  time  um this was from when i was younger this  is  from my older daughter's  father  and  i wanted to share about that um  abusive relationship  um it's kind of a touchy subject not  really a touchy subject just something  that you know  not my proudest hour  but i have no regrets because i got my  daughter out of it  and um  i will definitely link information on  domestic abuse below  hotlines and everything if any of you  have ever had any issues with that  mine wasn't nearly as bad as  other women's  of course any kind of abuse is horrible  whether it be physical or emotional or  mental or health whatever abuse is abuse  um  but  in the sense that you know i wasn't  beaten black and blue is what i mean by  the fact that mine wasn't as bad also i  have  always had a very good support system so  even though they didn't know what was  happening at the time when i finally did  leave  um  i did have family  there for me you know so  for me it is a lot different than a lot  of other  women  that have gone through this because i  did have i do have a support system i do  have  a lot so  anyway i'll just go ahead and start from  the beginning  i met him  through so this one girl i worked with  we would hang out  i wouldn't say we were friends and i  guess we were we would hang out we'd  party together and  this was her uncle  so  i met him through her  met him  okay fine whatever  and things moved really fast i was  not the smartest person at that time as  far as relationships um  yeah really fast like we met in like i  want to say april  and  by  august  i was  let's see april  i think like july  we were living together in august i was  pregnant with my daughter  um  and  before i even  we started living together he had  already been physical with me so  i don't know why i even let it get that  far  i do know why because god obviously  wanted me to have my daughter but also  you know lesson learned and um  but yeah so he was physical and then you  know once i was pregnant things just  really um  he never like punched me he would more  like pull my hair  mostly like pull my hair you know um and  like kind of like but like not like oh  you know like he'd like really pull my  hair like sometimes i would be losing my  hair like like that clumps of my hair  would fall out  um he would break things you know  especially things that were mine that he  knew meant something to me  he was also pretty um    like he always made it seem like i was  dumb even though i definitely was not  dumb you know i'm not dumb i never was  dumb i'm not a dumb person but he would  always be like  even like after i had my daughter and  like we had like some financial  um troubles i was like well you know i  can go get a job and he's like oh well  where are you going to work at  mcdonald's  even though when i met him i was working  in an office  um i had just graduated from  a um  a course that i had just taken on  computers and and um you know different  things it was a it was just like a  six-month program but i had just  finished that so  i graduated from high school like i'm  not dumb like  and i had  always  i've been working since i was like 15  years old since i could work and like i  said when i met him like i was working  in an office like  and then you're saying you know not not  to  dog anybody that works at mcdonald's i  have nothing against that but the way he  said it was like an insult you know i  mean  that's the way he made it seem was like  oh are you gonna work mcdonald's like i  there's nothing wrong with working at  mcdonald's okay yeah so i get a job at  mcdonald's it's an income  either way you know but it was just like  insulting and  he would always just say things like  that and like  that i was just like um  like a puppet just whatever everybody  else wanted me to do and maybe i was but  that's not something that your  significant other should be telling you  you know  should be making comments like that and  just  i know after i had my daughter i cut my  hair my hair was probably longer than it  is now this is as long as i've had my  hair in a long time um i've always for a  long time kept it pretty short like here  probably but um  anyway at that time it was longer than  this i was younger so it's probably like  that two here probably somewhere in  there  and so after i had her i cut it and i i  chopped it probably pretty short  probably like up to here so it's quite a  bit you know it's a big change you know  i understand that  but  you would have thought that like i had  you know chopped off his  left foot i don't know  and he just had the biggest fit about me  cutting my hair and like i wasn't  allowed to do anything i wasn't allowed  to  go to the store i wasn't allowed to  do anything i had to stay home  so yeah i wasn't allowed to work i  wasn't allowed to  visit my family my mom would stop by  every day  on her way to work because she worked  and so she would stop by  our place every day to see me and  the baby you know my baby at that time  and yeah you know that was that and then  so we lived when i first when we first  got together he had a little apartment  in like this  kind of seedy area  so moved in there and then we got broken  into  and so then  i wanted to move  i was still pregnant and he um  didn't want to but then he somebody  tried breaking in while we were at home  i was in the shower and i could hear him  yelling and yeah somebody was breaking  into our apartment when i was when we  were there and that's when i was like no  we need to move because there was  sometimes he would work out of town  and i would be there by myself i mean  there's no way i could do that  so we moved and we lived in this  like  i didn't want to say like mobile home  was more like like a little trailer it  was just a small little thing which was  fine you know and we lived in that  little thing for a little while that's  where  we were when i gave birth to my daughter  and took her home there  um his nephew lived with us for a while  there was like this small thing i don't  even know how we did that  and then  we moved out of there we actually got  kicked out because we didn't pay  this was i'm telling you horrible time  best and worst  because you know i have my daughter  so that was the greatest thing like she  is such a blessing to me  but the worst as far as  where i was mentally  and emotionally  and  physically you know  so we  left there and then i believe  we moved to an apart another apartment  with  so it's a two bedroom apartment with one  bathroom  and it it was me and him and  my daughter and then it was  his  niece  and her  sister so his two nieces and then his  one niece's  daughter  and then she was pregnant  so there was two  yeah that was a lot of people in a  two-bedroom with one bathroom that's  just not  very good so we lived there for a little  while  i believe then she  her the one niece and her child moved  out  because he was  so um  violent she didn't want her kids around  that which hello of course  so she moved out but his other niece  stayed there  and then  we moved out of there i believe we got  kicked out of there too but that wasn't  for non-payment it was because there was  some other stuff i don't even remember  it was like actually  his other niece it was in her name and  we weren't even supposed to be there so  i don't know is this big old debacle who  knows a lot of that stuff is really  hazy in my head at that time because  i think it's just things that i wanted  to try to block out you know  so then we moved in with my parents  um it was me and him and my daughter and  then his niece all moved in with my  parents  and  i believe my brother was living there  too because he's younger you know i  think he was even still in high school  or he had just graduated  so anyway there's a lot of things that i  could  probably don't even remember  that happened during that time  um  so shortly thereafter you know he wasn't  obviously real abusive because when  we're living with my family because he  couldn't be but he would like to go like  for drives or like he'd like to just go  sit out in the truck and listen to music  and he always had to have me there with  him like i wasn't allowed to be like  inside you know with the baby relaxing  and he could be out there drinking and  listening to music no i always had to be  with him you know so my baby would be  inside with like my mom  and i would be out in the truck with him  or would go for a drive or  you know he'd end up getting mad at me  about something accusing me of you know  looking at some guy the wrong way even  though i didn't even look at anybody or  you know i said something wrong or i  looked something you know it was always  something  another time he  i did leave him once um but then i ended  up going back because i don't even know  why it was just i think most of it was  because you know we had a child together  and i had never told anybody that he was  physically abusive or mentally  emotionally or anything kind of abusive  with me so i never said anything and it  was embarrassing it was embarrassing for  me especially the way the kind of person  that i've always been i was always like  very vocal and you know nobody's gonna  treat me bad and here i was in this  horrible shitty  predicament you know and i didn't know  how to get out of it and it was just  embarrassing and just horrible i was  just you know i didn't know what to do  so  anyway  then we're living with my parents  yeah one time we went he decided that he  wanted us to move  and we were  i don't know if we're gonna move to  texas i don't even remember and my mom  was like don't go with him you know he'd  been drinking and i was like you know  he was always drinking that's part of  the problem  and  he was drinking he was gonna get in the  driver's seat now you know i have me and  my child and i was like no i'm gonna  drive so of course he got mad at me  because i insisted on driving so he let  me drive  but then as soon as we just got up the  road from my parents house he started in  on me  and you know saying i made him look  stupid in front of my family and i think  he pulled my yeah he pulled he did hit  me he pulled my hair and he hit me  and i  think i was trying to turn back around  to come back this way through the  neighborhood come back to my parents  house through the neighborhood  and so i  you know he was  doing whatever so i  put the car in the truck in park and i  um  he would always use my daughter because  he knew obviously that's my baby  that that was the way to get to me so he  i think he got her out of the car  or maybe i did yeah i think and one of  us got her out  and  he started  running down the road with her away from  me  so i was running after him screaming and  i'm just yelling help me help me and he  turns on he's like i'm not gonna take  your baby from you and he hands her to  me and i just took off  running down the road back to my parents  house  and she was  maybe  two two and a half  so you know she's not big and heavy but  after you're carrying a baby a child for  a little while  they get heavy so  anyway um she had to walk for a little  bit and we weren't super far like maybe  like five blocks away but you know  that's a ways to run in the night  so i get back home  anyway  um you know we get back to my parents  and we're fine and  everything's fine whatever i don't even  remember exactly what happened i think  they called my brother because he was  like get out and  then he came back  but  long story short shortly thereafter i  told him i  i wanted him gone  so  he moved out  and then it was about a week we were  apart and he kept coming  wanting to get back together so finally  i was like okay  so i took him back but we were together  like a few days and i was just like i  don't want this this is not what i want  my life to be like i don't  want this i don't have good feelings for  him

          "content": "hi danielle here welcome to danielle's  corner today i wanted to share a story  time  um this was from when i was younger this  is  from my older daughter's  father  and  i wanted to share about that um  abusive relationship  um it's kind of a touchy subject not  really a touchy subject just something  that you know  not my proudest hour  but i have no regrets because i got my  daughter out of it  and um  i will definitely link information on  domestic abuse below  hotlines and everything if any of you  have ever had any issues with that  mine wasn't nearly as bad as  other women's  of course any kind of abuse is horrible  whether it be physical or emotional or  mental or health whatever abuse is abuse  um  but  in the sense that you know i wasn't  beaten black and blue is what i mean by  the fact that mine wasn't as bad also i  have  always had a very good support system so  even though they didn't know what was  happening at the time when i finally did  leave  um  i did have family  there for me you know so  for me it is a lot different than a lot  of other  women  that have gone through this because i  did have i do have a support system i do  have  a lot so  anyway i'll just go ahead and start from  the beginning  i met him  through so this one girl i worked with  we would hang out  i wouldn't say we were friends and i  guess we were we would hang out we'd  party together and  this was her uncle  so  i met him through her  met him  okay fine whatever  and things moved really fast i was  not the smartest person at that time as  far as relationships um  yeah really fast like we met in like i  want to say april  and  by  august  i was  let's see april  i think like july  we were living together in august i was  pregnant with my daughter  um  and  before i even  we started living together he had  already been physical with me so  i don't know why i even let it get that  far  i do know why because god obviously  wanted me to have my daughter but also  you know lesson learned and um  but yeah so he was physical and then you  know once i was pregnant things just  really um  he never like punched me he would more  like pull my hair  mostly like pull my hair you know um and  like kind of like but like not like oh  you know like he'd like really pull my  hair like sometimes i would be losing my  hair like like that clumps of my hair  would fall out  um he would break things you know  especially things that were mine that he  knew meant something to me  he was also pretty um    like he always made it seem like i was  dumb even though i definitely was not  dumb you know i'm not dumb i never was  dumb i'm not a dumb person but he would  always be like  even like after i had my daughter and  like we had like some financial  um troubles i was like well you know i  can go get a job and he's like oh well  where are you going to work at  mcdonald's  even though when i met him i was working  in an office  um i had just graduated from  a um  a course that i had just taken on  computers and and um you know different  things it was a it was just like a  six-month program but i had just  finished that so  i graduated from high school like i'm  not dumb like  and i had  always  i've been working since i was like 15  years old since i could work and like i  said when i met him like i was working  in an office like  and then you're saying you know not not  to  dog anybody that works at mcdonald's i  have nothing against that but the way he  said it was like an insult you know i  mean  that's the way he made it seem was like  oh are you gonna work mcdonald's like i  there's nothing wrong with working at  mcdonald's okay yeah so i get a job at  mcdonald's it's an income  either way you know but it was just like  insulting and  he would always just say things like  that and like  that i was just like um  like a puppet just whatever everybody  else wanted me to do and maybe i was but  that's not something that your  significant other should be telling you  you know  should be making comments like that and  just  i know after i had my daughter i cut my  hair my hair was probably longer than it  is now this is as long as i've had my  hair in a long time um i've always for a  long time kept it pretty short like here  probably but um  anyway at that time it was longer than  this i was younger so it's probably like  that two here probably somewhere in  there  and so after i had her i cut it and i i  chopped it probably pretty short  probably like up to here so it's quite a  bit you know it's a big change you know  i understand that  but  you would have thought that like i had  you know chopped off his  left foot i don't know  and he just had the biggest fit about me  cutting my hair and like i wasn't  allowed to do anything i wasn't allowed  to  go to the store i wasn't allowed to  do anything i had to stay home  so yeah i wasn't allowed to work i  wasn't allowed to  visit my family my mom would stop by  every day  on her way to work because she worked  and so she would stop by  our place every day to see me and  the baby you know my baby at that time  and yeah you know that was that and then  so we lived when i first when we first  got together he had a little apartment  in like this  kind of seedy area  so moved in there and then we got broken  into  and so then  i wanted to move  i was still pregnant and he um  didn't want to but then he somebody  tried breaking in while we were at home  i was in the shower and i could hear him  yelling and yeah somebody was breaking  into our apartment when i was when we  were there and that's when i was like no  we need to move because there was  sometimes he would work out of town  and i would be there by myself i mean  there's no way i could do that  so we moved and we lived in this  like  i didn't want to say like mobile home  was more like like a little trailer it  was just a small little thing which was  fine you know and we lived in that  little thing for a little while that's  where  we were when i gave birth to my daughter  and took her home there  um his nephew lived with us for a while  there was like this small thing i don't  even know how we did that  and then  we moved out of there we actually got  kicked out because we didn't pay  this was i'm telling you horrible time  best and worst  because you know i have my daughter  so that was the greatest thing like she  is such a blessing to me  but the worst as far as  where i was mentally  and emotionally  and  physically you know  so we  left there and then i believe  we moved to an apart another apartment  with  so it's a two bedroom apartment with one  bathroom  and it it was me and him and  my daughter and then it was  his  niece  and her  sister so his two nieces and then his  one niece's  daughter  and then she was pregnant  so there was two  yeah that was a lot of people in a  two-bedroom with one bathroom that's  just not  very good so we lived there for a little  while  i believe then she  her the one niece and her child moved  out  because he was  so um  violent she didn't want her kids around  that which hello of course  so she moved out but his other niece  stayed there  and then  we moved out of there i believe we got  kicked out of there too but that wasn't  for non-payment it was because there was  some other stuff i don't even remember  it was like actually  his other niece it was in her name and  we weren't even supposed to be there so  i don't know is this big old debacle who  knows a lot of that stuff is really  hazy in my head at that time because  i think it's just things that i wanted  to try to block out you know  so then we moved in with my parents  um it was me and him and my daughter and  then his niece all moved in with my  parents  and  i believe my brother was living there  too because he's younger you know i  think he was even still in high school  or he had just graduated  so anyway there's a lot of things that i  could  probably don't even remember  that happened during that time  um  so shortly thereafter you know he wasn't  obviously real abusive because when  we're living with my family because he  couldn't be but he would like to go like  for drives or like he'd like to just go  sit out in the truck and listen to music  and he always had to have me there with  him like i wasn't allowed to be like  inside you know with the baby relaxing  and he could be out there drinking and  listening to music no i always had to be  with him you know so my baby would be  inside with like my mom  and i would be out in the truck with him  or would go for a drive or  you know he'd end up getting mad at me  about something accusing me of you know  looking at some guy the wrong way even  though i didn't even look at anybody or  you know i said something wrong or i  looked something you know it was always  something  another time he  i did leave him once um but then i ended  up going back because i don't even know  why it was just i think most of it was  because you know we had a child together  and i had never told anybody that he was  physically abusive or mentally  emotionally or anything kind of abusive  with me so i never said anything and it  was embarrassing it was embarrassing for  me especially the way the kind of person  that i've always been i was always like  very vocal and you know nobody's gonna  treat me bad and here i was in this  horrible shitty  predicament you know and i didn't know  how to get out of it and it was just  embarrassing and just horrible i was  just you know i didn't know what to do  so  anyway  then we're living with my parents  yeah one time we went he decided that he  wanted us to move  and we were  i don't know if we're gonna move to  texas i don't even remember and my mom  was like don't go with him you know he'd  been drinking and i was like you know  he was always drinking that's part of  the problem  and  he was drinking he was gonna get in the  driver's seat now you know i have me and  my child and i was like no i'm gonna  drive so of course he got mad at me  because i insisted on driving so he let  me drive  but then as soon as we just got up the  road from my parents house he started in  on me  and you know saying i made him look  stupid in front of my family and i think  he pulled my yeah he pulled he did hit  me he pulled my hair and he hit me  and i  think i was trying to turn back around  to come back this way through the  neighborhood come back to my parents  house through the neighborhood  and so i  you know he was  doing whatever so i  put the car in the truck in park and i  um  he would always use my daughter because  he knew obviously that's my baby  that that was the way to get to me so he  i think he got her out of the car  or maybe i did yeah i think and one of  us got her out  and  he started  running down the road with her away from  me  so i was running after him screaming and  i'm just yelling help me help me and he  turns on he's like i'm not gonna take  your baby from you and he hands her to  me and i just took off  running down the road back to my parents  house  and she was  maybe  two two and a half  so you know she's not big and heavy but  after you're carrying a baby a child for  a little while  they get heavy so  anyway um she had to walk for a little  bit and we weren't super far like maybe  like five blocks away but you know  that's a ways to run in the night  so i get back home  anyway  um you know we get back to my parents  and we're fine and  everything's fine whatever i don't even  remember exactly what happened i think  they called my brother because he was  like get out and  then he came back  but  long story short shortly thereafter i  told him i  i wanted him gone  so  he moved out  and then it was about a week we were  apart and he kept coming  wanting to get back together so finally  i was like okay  so i took him back but we were together  like a few days and i was just like i  don't want this this is not what i want  my life to be like i don't  want this i don't have good feelings for  him  about him about  this that's going on with us i just  don't have  good feelings i don't want this  so  i told my family i'm gonna tell him i  want him gone  and so yeah that next weekend i told him  i  wanted him gone and i didn't want to be  with him any longer and  so  he left and he stayed    around for  about five to six months he would come  and he would take  my daughter here and there he

      "content": "There we go, keep doing it. There we go. I was just like fucking around, but if you're serious, I'm like good. Hey guys, welcome back to my channel. It is Celeste Rose, a.k.a. Sal Sarosa. So for today's video, it's going to be more on a serious note, and I'm opening up to you guys specifically about something that, I mean, I know you guys, a lot of you guys know about, but I've never actually said it in the detail that I'm about to say right now. Not fully, fully, fully detailed, because that's just something that shouldn't really not be on YouTube. I'm going to open up to you guys a little bit about it, because I just feel like, not only does this story make me who I am, and it has shaped me to the person that I am today, but I feel like, and I hope that my story can help you guys, in any way. Hope that me telling you guys this, and how it made me feel, and what I've been through, and who I am now, can help you guys in any way, or someone in your family, one of your guys' friends, I don't know, but I'm here to tell you a little bit of what I have been through in an abusive relationship, and just, I hope that it can help you guys, or even, you know, warn you guys for what to look out for, and what to not stay for. Let me first and foremost say that me and this person no longer communicate. We do not have any bad blood. She's doing her own thing, and I am definitely doing my own. And, um, I wish her all well. No hard feelings towards this person whatsoever, and, um, I mean, we don't get bitter, we get better. Hello! So, my whole life, I've always felt like a burden. I've always felt very, very sad, and depressed, and very alone, and just very unwanted, and very useless, and unworthy. I grew up being compared to other people all the time. Be more like her, be more like him, blah, blah, blah. Not to mention, I was always a fuck-up in school, and I would always be getting kicked out of schools, fighting, blah, blah, blah. You guys already know. I was just, I always felt like I wasn't shit, because I felt like I was never good enough for anybody, because everyone was always comparing me to other people, and be more like them, be more like her. And then I lost all confidence in myself, and I didn't know how to love myself. I didn't know who I was. I didn't know what steps to take in order to love myself, and I didn't know exactly how to go about that, because I've never been through this. And that's when I went off to military school. Sunburst Academy, Class 7. This place completely saved my life. And when I was in military school, not only did they teach us so many things about school, so many things about life, so many things about even fitness, loving yourself, they taught us everything. And when I was in military school there for pretty much six, seven months, I promised myself I would never lose myself again. And I found myself again, and I was so happy, and I was so content, and I was so proud of myself. And I was like, look, you lost yourself one time in high school. You were unhappy, and you were depressed, but don't do that ever again. Don't do it. Like, just don't. And that promise meant a lot to me, because, I mean, losing yourself is the most painful thing ever, whether you lose yourself because you lost a family member, you lose yourself trying to love somebody else, you lose yourself trying to give. You lose yourself trying to give your life to somebody else in a relationship while you sit there hungry, starving, and you feel unloved. And you can lose yourself in many other ways, but this is pretty much, like, the gist of it. I graduated military school, and I walked down that aisle. I was like, yo, I feel so good. I'm so happy. I'm proud of myself. I know who I am, and I'm content, you know? Then, after high school, when I graduated, and I first got into college, I met someone, and we were friends for a little bit. It was actually a very, very good friendship, and a couple weeks later of us being friends, I ended up moving to San Diego. And, yeah, I love San Diego so much. If you know me on a personal level, you know that I love San Diego. Like, it's so nice, yo. She ended up confessing her feelings towards me, blah, blah, blah. And then we got in a relationship together and whatnot, but she was, like, what, three, four hours from me. Have you ever been so in love or so in lust or so for a person that you will do anything for them? Eventually, you start blaming yourself for their mistakes and their actions. In the beginning, you try not to, but after a while, you're like, I love you so much. And it's like, when they fuck up, you're like, yo, was it me? Am I not worth it? And that's what happened to me in that relationship. And I promised myself I would never lose myself again, but that's something that I could not control, and I ended up losing myself loving somebody else for pretty much four and a half to five years, and it was a nightmare. Now, I'm not going to sit here in front saying, oh, it was all bad, blah, blah, blah. No. I mean, regardless, it was a very, very bad relationship. I mean, when we had our good times, it was our good times, but overall, it was a very, very fucked up relationship. First time? Yeah. This person ever laid hands on me was actually one month into our relationship, and I really let it go for five years. I let that abuse go on and on and on and on and on because I thought in my head, I was like, nah, I'm going to ride or die. Fuck that, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But that's not the case, yo. And I'm so glad I let myself for five years because if you guys would have met me five years ago, well, not, like, more than five years, but if you guys would have met me before that relationship, I mean, yeah, I'm still the same person. Like, I'm super nice. I mean, I think I'm nice. I got a big heart. You know, I do a lot of things for other people, but my mentality changed while being with that person, and I was super, super weak-minded, and I was very, very unhappy and very, very insecure with myself. And if I were to look at myself back then, five years before the relationship started, I wouldn't even be able to recognize myself, but I'm so glad. I'm so glad I've grown from that. But like I said, the abuse started after one month, and after that, it got horrible. She would punch me. She would smack me. She would slap me. She would choke me. She would just do a bunch of things to me and just try to, you know, brainwash me and manipulate me and just to get me to stay. Because of this person, I had to walk home barefoot one time because she kicked me out of the car and we got in a fight. Made me take my shoes off. Made me take my socks off. It was a super, super hot day over there, and I was about to leave the house. And my feet were bleeding. Yo, it was so hot that day. And I was walking on rocks and dirt and sidewalks, and I had no socks and shoes, and she just kept driving down and laughing at me and laughing at me. And I'm like, yo, this hurts. And then there was this car that pulled up next to me. I remember her. And she was in a black car, and she was like, what's going on? And I was like, oh, I'm good, thank you. Like, I'm fine. And she was like, why are you walking without shoes, and why are you crying like that? She was like, you know, we can all see you crying driving by, right? And I'm like, okay, I'm good, thank you, though. And she was like, let me help you. And I was like, I'm okay, like, really, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm always good. And she was like, let me help you. She was like, can I guess your situation? And I was like, okay. And she was like, are you in an abusive relationship? And I was like, yeah. Like, how did you know? And she was like, because I used to be in one. And if I get emotional, yo, I'm so sorry. Like, I'm really trying not to. Like, I feel like I've cried on, like, four of my YouTube videos already. But it's super, super hard to talk about. But... She was like, can I take you home? Like, let me take you to wherever you're headed to. And I was like, I'm okay. And she was like, I'm not leaving until you let me take you. And in my mind, I was like, yo, like, you know, my parents always taught me to never, you know, get in the car with strangers, blah, blah, blah. But then again, I felt like this was, like, an angel. I know it sounds crazy, but I was like... I didn't get any bad vibes, so I got in the car with her. And the minute I got into the car and I told her where to go, I started crying. And she was like, you're gonna be okay. I need you to do me a favor, though. And I was like, yeah. And she was like, just please leave that relationship. It's not gonna get better. And I was like, yeah, I know, I know. I'm gonna leave, I'm gonna leave, I'm gonna leave. But I never left. At least at that moment. I remember myself, after getting hit so many times, crying in the corner of my bathroom. Whether I was bruised up or scratched up or there was blood. And I remember sitting in the corner of my bathroom shaking so hard and so fast and just wondering how I got here. Wondering how I lost myself. Wondering how I'm allowing myself to go through this because I love you so much. But it obviously was not reciprocated. Out of all the times she's ever hit me, this time was the worst. Because we were in the car and she was driving and then she wanted to commit suicide. She says she was suicidal, but she's not. Because suicidal people, you know, that exists. And that's a very, very sad, scary thing. But there's also other people that pretend to be suicidal to brainwash somebody and to manipulate somebody. To getting what they want. And they're not suicidal. Some people are. And that's why you don't mess with that. Because people struggle with that every day. And that's nothing to joke about. But there was one time whenever she was driving and I was in the passenger seat. And I had broken up with her that night in the car. And she was like, you're really going to leave me? Like, you're really going to leave me? And I was like, yeah. Like, I'm not happy anymore. So she grabbed some pills that she had. I don't even know for what they were. I don't remember. And then she's driving with one hand, the other hand. Like, she has all the pills in her hand. And then she's about to do this. Put it in her mouth. Like, try to commit suicide to brainwash me. And then I'm in the passenger seat. And I did that to her hand. And all the pills flew everywhere. And then she looked at me. She started laughing. And she was like, you fucked up. And I was scared for my life. So she grabbed my hair and started banging my head up against the window like that while she was driving. And I was just like, my head was going back and forth. And I was like, so scared, yo. Like, she was mad scary. Like, I'm not afraid of nobody. But whenever you're in a relationship, an abusive relationship, it's just mad scary. But I'm not afraid of nobody. But her face was all up against the window. She kept banging it and then socking me in the head. And then trying to like rip my hair and then socking me in the shoulder because I'm still in the passenger seat. And then I started huddling up like that. And I grabbed my phone, you know, to call my dad. And then she grabs my phone and then breaks it, throws it. I don't know if she throws it out the window or in the trunk. And then she was like, we're going to pull into Denny's. You're going to get your shit together. And you're going to get out of the fucking car. And you're going to act like nothing ever happened because if you tell somebody that I hit you, I'm going to fucking fuck you up. And of course, I listened. So we got into Denny's and whatnot. And it was just so bad. I was like sitting there just lifeless just like that looking at her. I was so scared. She was in front of me. And then it was just a very, very scary thing. That night, we just ended up horribly. We ended up parking in a street and she grabbed me. I tried to run out the car. I tried to run out of the car. And then I literally opened the door and I was running so fast. So I opened the door and I ran towards the back of the car. And I was running down the street and running and running. And I was like, just go. Just go. Just go. Just go. And I was like, just go. Just go. Just go. Just go. And she got a hold of me, grabbed me by my hair, threw me on the floor, and dragged me by my hair all the way back to the car. And then when she threw me in the car, my leg was sticking out and she just kept slamming my legs in the door. And that shit, like, it is fucking... When you go through shit like that, yo, it really fucks you up. It changes you and it makes you scared to love again. And I know not everybody is like that. I understand that because, I mean, I'm different myself. But it's super scary. But everything that I'm telling you guys, that's literally... I know it's hard to believe because that's very traumatic. But that is 1% of that five-year relationship. 1% of what I'm telling you. I could sit here for hours and days and tell you all these stories that you guys would not even believe. But I guess what I'm trying to say is that, you know, abuse is real. And abuse is not okay. And abuse is always... It can go whether it's mentally, physically, emotionally, verbal abuse. All I can do is I can thank myself because I got out of that on my own. If he hit you once or if she hit you once, it's gonna happen again, yo. Every single time I would get abused by her, every single time I would go into the bathroom and I would look at myself, you know, in the mirror. And I was like, yo, is it me? Is it me? Am I not good enough? Am I ugly? What's wrong with me? That was where I fucked up. I fucked up on blaming myself for her faults, blaming myself for her actions, blaming myself for her mistakes and her choices. It's not mistakes, it's not a mistake but her choice. But I am here to tell you that if you are in an abusive relationship or it's starting to get abusive, or you know someone in an abusive relationship, I encourage you guys to get the fuck out of that relationship. Okay. the fuck out because I promise you it will not get better. I mean, I think people could change. Yeah. But it's not your job to fix them. It is not your job to change them. And just because you sit there and you stay in a relationship does not make you a ride or die. No, it does not ride or die is someone who sticks around to the good and to the bad, you know, good days and bad days. Not someone who, who doesn't give a fuck about you while you're sitting here giving them a life. They're slowly taking yours from you. Although I have the same heart from when I was a little girl, I have the same energy. I still, I'm just, I have the same personality. I'm always laughing. I'm always helping people more. I'm not trying to like to my own horn here, but it just, I'm explaining who I am. Like, I'm just, I think I'm super nice. I don't know. I don't want to sound like I'm not humble, but I do a lot for others. And I'm always laughing. Even if I'm having a bad day, like I'm always laughing. I'm the same person as I've always have been. Like, but I have changed. A lot when it comes, you know, mentally and all that. And now I'm the strongest person that I know. I'm so glad I got out of that relationship because some people, as sad as it is to say, they never get out. This is a very serious topic and a very serious thing. And if you've ever gotten out of one, I'm so proud of you. And if you are in one right now and you don't know how to get out, I need you to get out. No ifs, ands, or buts. Don't question yourself. Don't tell yourself things are going to change. Don't tell yourself that he's not going to hit you again, and she's not going to hit you again. Don't tell yourself that because it's going to happen again. Because I told myself, I told myself that too. I was like, it's not going to happen again. Like, we're getting better. Like, we're happy now. Like, we're good. But you deserve better than that. You deserve somebody that respects you the way you can respect them. Someone that loves you the way you can love them. Someone that can do for you as much as you can do for them. Someone that caters to your every want, to your every need. And someone that never makes you feel insecure. Someone that reassures you, even on your bad days, even on your good days. Someone that makes you feel loved, even when you guys are fighting. Someone that makes you feel safe, even when you guys are fighting. Someone that makes you feel wanted and so beautiful, even during your ugliest argument. Someone that respects you and loves you the way that you should be. And I'm so glad I went through that. And I let myself for five years because I have never been stronger. And I'm only getting stronger. And I'm so proud of myself because the more shit I go through, the more struggles I go through, the more pain I go through, the stronger I am. So that's why. Now I don't settle for less. I don't settle for damn near anybody or anything because I know my worth. I know what I've been through. I know my story. I know what I can bring to the table. And if I feel like they can't, then they can't. It is what it is. It's cool. But I have never been so happy and so content with being, being me and being so proud and loving myself. So I encourage you guys to just love yourself enough a little more this time to just leave that relationship and know that it's going to get better. And I promise you, although you may not believe me now because I didn't believe anybody either when they told me that. But with that being said, thank you guys so much for watching this video. And I still have so much more to say, yo. This is like 1% of what I've been through, but I'm not going to sit here and just talk your guys' ear off a bit more. But I just hope this video brings awareness and maybe wake some people up. Let them know that, you know, it's okay and you're going to be okay. But I need you guys to do the right thing. I need you guys to leave. If I've been through this and if I could get this right, I would. I would. If I could get through this, me, fucking Solis, and I could find happiness again with myself, you guys can too. I believe in you guys. But as always, as always, not only am I proud of you guys, but you guys are worth it. You guys are beautiful. You guys are handsome. Whatever the fuck you consider yourself, that's what you are. And I'm proud of all of you, regardless whether you did something beautiful today or you just, you woke up and you were a little, you loved yourself a little more today. I'm proud of you guys for everything. But as always, Solis Rose, a.k.a. Salsa Rosita. I love you guys. Bye.",

      "content": "When I was a teenager, I was in a relationship, and it wasn\u2019t a good one. I\u2019m the world\u2019s worst when it comes to self-doubt and one of the hardest things for me was not knowing whether what was happening was abusive or just\u2026 sort-of-bad. Was I overreacting? Had he just had a hard life? Did he need my help?\n\nI\u2019d always been taught that proper, grown-up, real relationships are based on forgiveness and \u2018trying again\u2019 and give and take. That kind of mindset is good, when you\u2019re in a healthy relationship and your partner takes the same viewpoint \u2013 not so good when your significant other grabs that giving side of you and metaphorically throws up all over it. There are a bunch of things I wish I\u2019d known back then \u2013 and with the tiniest hint of clarity, years later, I\u2019d like to be able to pass them on.\n\n1. Just because you\u2019re not living with someone, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not abuse\nI didn\u2019t know what to call it. Whenever I typed \u2018domestic abuse\u2019 into Google, anything that came up was always to do with wives who cried and husbands who drank and people who lived together. I wound up feeling like my teenage situation clearly wasn\u2019t worth a charity website and therefore wasn\u2019t as bad as I felt it to be.\n\nI think this was pretty damaging, and although I\u2019m glad that more is done now to reassure younger people that their situation is just as real and scary as a 40 year-old\u2019s, I still don\u2019t think we\u2019re THERE. I think there are some big misconceptions when it comes to violence and controlling behaviour in teen relationships, and I think there are some even bigger gender inequality issues that still lurk around and rear their ugly heads every day.\n\n2. Just because someone doesn\u2019t hit you square in the face, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not abuse\nWhen someone tells you about abuse, you picture black eyes \u2013 not sharp pinches when you get wolf whistled at or arm scratches if you do something wrong \u2013 and when you\u2019re being abused you tell yourself that unless you get punched in the face, it\u2019s not really anything that anyone would care about. Isn\u2019t that sad?\n\nDon\u2019t listen to that nasty, doubting voice in your head that says \u201cIt\u2019s nothing\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m overreacting\u201d \u2013 if someone who claims to care for you is hurting you, that\u2019s NOT okay.\n\nSometimes there\u2019s no physical element to things at all. If your partner seems to enjoy teasing or bullying you (I don\u2019t mean joking around, I mean degrading and humiliating teasing that\u2019s designed to put you down), or breaking or ruining your possessions, that\u2019s abuse. If they get jealous and explode over seemingly minor things, like when you spend the morning with your grandad or the fact that you wore a tight t-shirt last Thursday, that\u2019s also abuse.\n\nIf the word \u2018abuse\u2019 feels a bit much, that\u2019s okay. But I think inside you\u2019ll know. There\u2019s a difference between someone who cares about you and wants to check you\u2019re safe when you\u2019re home late from work and someone who bombards you with texts all day to see where you are and swears at you when you take longer than 30 seconds to reply.\n\n3. If they they want to spend every second of every day with you, it\u2019s okay to not be okay with that\nAs a teenage girl, I had this weird, ingrained THING where I thought that a jealous, clingy boyfriend equalled a boyfriend who cared. I feel like a lot of the men who reside in Young Adult Fiction Land do really creepy/lurky things, like turning up in the middle of the night unannounced and uninvited (I\u2019M LOOKING AT YOU, EDWARD CULLEN), or appearing out of a far-off hedge to punch someone who is harassing the female lead \u2013 so as someone who was used to reading and watching that sort of thing, I didn\u2019t pay attention to the loud alarm bells ringing in my head at the start of my relationship. I just guessed that I had not known a truly caring boyfriend before. I HAD.\n\nOnly you can decide what works for you in a relationship, what\u2019s normal and what\u2019s not \u2013 some couples are happy to be joined at the hip and other people like to not speak for two weeks. I guess it\u2019s whatever you and your partner prefer. But if you\u2019re becoming stressed or uncomfortable with what\u2019s being asked of you, let them know.\n\nIf they refuse to compromise or it doesn\u2019t feel right, you\u2019re under no obligation to stick around.\n\n4. If you\u2019re always having to stick up for them, there\u2019s probably a reason for it\nIf you feel like you\u2019re constantly having to defend your partner to others, that adds an extra strain to everything \u2013 you\u2019re not only getting sh*t from them all the time but also from everyone else. Why do people feel this way about them? Why are you always having to reassure everyone that they\u2019re not the worst? There are always exceptions to the rule, but I think that, chances are, if the people closest to you seem uncomfortable with them and can give you solid examples as to why, there\u2019s something there.\n\n5. If you never have to defend them and everyone seems to love them, it\u2019s okay to still feel uneasy about that relationship \u2013 or to end it\nI get that this is a little different to part 4, but what I mean is that sometimes people who are abusive can really turn on the charm. One minute you\u2019re being shouted at and called a slut but the next minute everything\u2019s perfect for your evening out and your pals are giggling away at Mr/Mrs Hilarious who has magically forgotten everything that made them so angry but a moment ago. Everyone else has a great night and basks in how wonderful your partner is, while you sit there shaking and afraid to speak.\n\nSometimes, other people are just nervous to tell you their real feelings. I used to occasionally pluck up the courage to tell people what was happening to me in an \u2018I\u2019m-just-gonna-drop-this-into-conversation-but-it-doesn\u2019t-really-bother-me-too-much\u2019 kind of way to check whether I was \u2018right\u2019 to be upset at my boyfriend, and not one person ever said \u201cWhat a tool, you should break up with him\u201d, which led to a lot of self-doubt. Months later, someone I\u2019d confided in at college said to me: \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re not with him anymore \u2013 we always hated him and what you told us about him but we didn\u2019t really know what to say.\u201d\n\nMy point is, not everyone will cotton on to your partner\u2019s behaviour.\n\nSome people might think they\u2019re the bee\u2019s knees. That doesn\u2019t make your feelings about them any less valid \u2013 you know what\u2019s happening better than anyone else. Kick that bee in the back of the leg and run.\n\n6. Your partner may not recognise that they\u2019re an abuser\nMy ex has never apologised to me. Everyone has their own truth and I think that in his head he\u2019s a normal guy with normal behaviours and if someone at work asked him if he\u2019d ever been abusive I\u2019m 99% sure his response would be an immediate \u201cNo!\u201d\n\nBut in my experience, no-one thinks they\u2019re an abuser.\n\nI imagine it\u2019s incredibly rare for someone to hold their hands up, even years later, and say those words, just like I don\u2019t think anyone would call themselves a rapist. People imagine abusers as beer-drinking 40 year-old men with anger issues and terrible backstories. They picture rapists as greasy monsters in long coats who lurk down the alleyways your mum always told you to avoid. And so the ones we encounter get away with it. Why would people who\u2019d hurt us be disguised as eighteen year-olds who are only just beginning to shed their childhood faces and keep using the word \u201clove\u201d?\n\n7. If you\u2019re with someone who cares about you, you shouldn\u2019t feel like a lesser version of who you used to be\nI always remember this one day where I cried so hard my stomach hurt and my head felt like it had a crack in it and I said out loud \u201cYou are trying to ruin me.\u201d I think one of the most awful things that someone in an abusive relationship can experience is that feeling that you\u2019re no longer the person you were \u2013 and now you\u2019ve lost it, you\u2019re too far gone to get that person back, and even if you weren\u2019t, you can\u2019t remember what they were even like to begin with.\n\nI still tell my boyfriend now that I don\u2019t have a proper personality, even though the roots of me know that\u2019s not true. I feel as if I softened it a lot for my ex. I remember reading a piece about emotional abuse by Lauren Laverne \u2013 she said that when you\u2019re with someone abusive, you feel like they\u2019ve trapped you in a box, and even though you remove all of the loud, offensive parts of your personality for that person so you won\u2019t touch the sides, the box keeps getting smaller anyway. I think that\u2019s a really good way of describing it.\n\n8. If they think you\u2019re so terrible, why are they with you?\nI think this is the crux of it all and it\u2019s what I wish I\u2019d kept in my head from the get-go. You might be told how awful you are and how embarrassing it was when you did this and how disgusting you looked when you wore that, but surely they don\u2019t really feel that way about the person they\u2019re dating.\n\nDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s more likely that their investment is in making you feel bad and slowly turning you into someone who\u2019ll stick around?\n\nWho can hear that they\u2019re ugly and boring and a waste of space every day and then find the courage to disappear?\n\nI used to feel bad for my abuser and told myself (and others) that it was probably insecurity and worry that had caused him to act that way. I made out that it wasn\u2019t his fault. But the thing is, I\u2019m as insecure as they come and I worry about pretty much everything ever. Mirrors are not my friend, I can\u2019t swallow properly in group meetings through nerves and sometimes I have dreams about my boyfriend meeting a skinny, blonde lady at the petrol station who he marries and then makes plans to laugh at me with. I KNOW I\u2019M CRAZY. I know that confidence is not my middle name (it\u2019s Jo). I think I am probably as neurotic as they come, but I try to have the self control and compassion not to shift that onto someone else who doesn\u2019t deserve it and has done nothing to make me feel that way.\n\nThe key to your happiness is not someone else\u2019s sadness. The way to maintain a relationship is not to guilt and frighten the other person into staying. If someone tells you that the reason they act the way they do is _______ or ______ then fine \u2013 people get hurt and events affect us and we all struggle.\n\nBut we need to be able to recognise this in ourselves and work to better our flaws and tell our insecurities to leave us alone. It\u2019s not okay to use them as an excuse to chip away at others.\n\nBeing in a relationship like this left a deep-rooted self-dislike in me which other people who\u2019ve cared for me have struggled to remove. No matter how much someone tells you you\u2019re swell, the words of someone else who said the complete opposite will always somehow ring truer. It\u2019s been years since I was with my ex but I still get upset when I see a domestic violence storyline on TV or if someone is being intimidating towards their partner in Tesco or something. The only reason I wanted to watch Little Shop of Horrors was because I knew I\u2019d take solace in the fact that some people\u2019s abusive boyfriends get fed to giant plants. I walk into a room and I have to repeat in my head \u201cYou\u2019re as good as everyone else in here\u201d over and over again to keep myself from running back out.\n\nI am still working really hard on getting to know myself again but I know I can do it. I got away from it, and so can you. I\u2019m angry. Please trust your gut.\n\n",

      "content": "I met Shaun online\nI met Shaun online, on Twitter, when I was thirteen, nearly fourteen. I ran a fan page for a TV show and we got chatting about how much we loved the program. He was super-friendly, always joking around and giving me compliments. I didn\u2019t have many friends in the real world, I\u2019d been bullied at school and didn\u2019t get on well with my parents, so talking to Shaun was a welcome distraction. When he asked me to be his girlfriend I was ecstatic. Looking back it was too intense, he\u2019d send me eight-page word documents telling me how much he loved me and turn down going out with his friends just to talk to me online, but he was my first boyfriend and three years older than me so I was flattered by the attention.\n\nAbout six months after we met online I was forced into hospital with anorexia against my will. I was very homesick \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t let me have any access to the internet and I only got my phone once a day to call my family. I tried to keep in contact with Shaun but it was too difficult, and I was more worried about being put on a mental health section and sent to a secure unit (which was a constant threat). After a month or so I broke up with him and I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal because we\u2019d never even met face to face.\n\nShaun was absolutely furious. He said I\u2019d ruined his entire life and swore at me in texts and called me a bitch. I didn\u2019t think much of it and I didn\u2019t tell the hospital staff or my mum. During the next few months I gradually got more leave from hospital and we spoke on and off, sometimes we\u2019d get into arguments and he\u2019d sulk and refuse to talk to me for a few days. He could be quite nasty when he was angry but I still thought it was just normal bickering. I\u2019d say to anyone in that situation now, to stop it really early on.\n\nIf someone is shouting at you or calling you names then they aren\u2019t worth your attention. Make it clear that you won\u2019t put up with it and remember whatever you\u2019ve done to upset them, bullying someone like that is never okay.\n\nMeeting face-to-face\nIn April 2012 we arranged to meet face to face for the first time; Shaun got the coach to where I live and met me and my mum. He was incredibly shy and polite, shaking hands with my mum and thanking her for meeting him. When we were left on our own he was still tentative, we held hands and hugged goodbye but he didn\u2019t try anything else so me and mum were both reassured! He came to stay with us for a night so he could come to my fifteenth birthday party and impressed my parents again by sleeping on the sofa. We had our first kiss on the bouncy castle at my party with One Direction\u2019s What Makes You Beautiful playing in the background. That was \u2018our song\u2019 because he used to sing it to me on webcam.\n\nI think people often don\u2019t realise that even when someone goes on to be really vile and abusive they can be really nice too. If there hadn\u2019t been good times with Shaun I would never have stayed through the bad ones.\n\nOver the next few months Shaun came to stay with us lots of times and I went to stay with him in Birmingham. When we met he was the perfect boyfriend, charming and devoted, always buying me presents and taking me on dates. In between visits it was a bit different\u2026 He\u2019d lose his temper a lot and scream and call me names like a slag and a whore. He started self-harming because he was stressed about exams but sometimes he said it was because I made him so unhappy. He wanted to kill himself and stashed fifty boxes of paracetamol ready for an overdose. I saw them when I visited him but he said if I told anyone he\u2019d take them straight away and it would be my fault. I was terrified and told my mum who eventually told his mum, but they both swore not to say I told them.\n\nWhenever we argued it always seemed to go back to how I\u2019d broken up with him when I was in hospital. He insisted something about me had changed and I was no longer the \u2018sweet, caring girl\u2019 he met online in 2011. He still wanted to be my boyfriend but he could never love me quite as much as before. I often asked what had changed but he\u2019d say it was no good telling me because \u2018I might try to change back and it wouldn\u2019t be genuine\u2019 so instead I would have to work it out for myself. I think it was in the first few months after we got back together that he really got me under his control.\n\nI tried harder and harder to be exactly who he wanted. I reread our previous conversations trying to figure out how I\u2019d changed.\n\nNothing ever worked, he was always nice face to face but in between it got worse and worse. He\u2019d go on about how ugly girls looked in trousers or tops that weren\u2019t low cut enough, he also accused me of dressing like a slut. I planned every outfit I\u2019d wear when we met. If you\u2019re changing your behaviour because you\u2019re worried how your boyfriend or girlfriend will react that\u2019s a definite sign that they\u2019re not treating you right. No one should be frightened in a relationship or feel like they can\u2019t be themselves.\n\nThe assault\nI ended up letting him do sexual things I wasn\u2019t comfortable with because it was better than saying no and dealing with him losing his temper. One time when we were kissing he grabbed me hard between my legs and just kept grabbing with his whole hand and nails. It hurt so much I had to grit my teeth to hold back tears. He also put his hand inside my knickers and it really hurt so I tried to put my hand in front of his to block him, but he pushed me out the way. I pulled his arm up and told him to touch my breasts instead, but he laughed and said the other thing was more fun and carried on. I didn\u2019t realise at the time that what he did was sexual assault and therefore illegal.\n\nOnce on the phone I\u2019d told him I had been slightly nervous about something and he\u2019d sulked and refused to talk to me for days, he said if I didn\u2019t like it we should never meet again. After that, I always told him I was ok with everything.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned since is, consent isn\u2019t as simple as what you say is okay.\n\nHe\u2019d got me so completely under his control I wouldn\u2019t have said no to anything. I didn\u2019t stop him, but I didn\u2019t say I enjoyed it or encourage him either, I was just silent. I\u2019d say to anyone in a similar situation now: if someone is abusing you then you don\u2019t have the capacity to consent, there\u2019s no free choice even if they don\u2019t threaten or force you at the time.\n\nBreaking up (again)\nOur relationship continued until September 2012 when we formally broke up because he said I just wasn\u2019t the same person anymore. We didn\u2019t meet again for a little while, but we still spoke to each other as if we were boyfriend and girlfriend and had an agreement not to see anyone else. The only difference was that it was okay for him to flirt with girls online but if I even put an \u2018x\u2019 on the end of a message to a boy I was a \u2018dirty whore and obviously wanted to have sex with them\u2019. Sometimes I would point out how hypocritical he was and he would say I was too insecure, insecurity had ruined our relationship and I would have to be cured if we were to get back together. I believed him because I was quite unconfident, especially about my appearance because I have anorexia. Shaun started coming up with strategies to cure my insecurity. They involved periods of days or weeks where I wasn\u2019t allowed to speak to him at all. If I broke the agreement and contacted him extra days would be added on. Funnily enough he always contacted me before the time was up and there were never any consequences for that.\n\nI was resigned to playing by his rules, anything else and he lost his temper.\n\nI\u2019d started a new school and left the hospital in September and I think I felt I needed him then because he was the only person who really understood what I\u2019d been through in hospital and how bad my relationship was with my parents.\n\nWe would be on the phone on and off all night so I was too exhausted to go to school. Shaun would hang up saying he was on the edge of a building ready to jump and then not pick up the phone for several hours. I told my mum almost everything because I was so scared he would die and it would be my fault. She didn\u2019t want me to stay with him, but she couldn\u2019t stop me either.\n\nIn March 2013 I was meeting Shaun in Birmingham and I got to the train station early, as I sat in a coffee shop waiting for him he texted me to say he knew I was having sex in the public toilets. He sent streams of messages calling me a slag and a prostitute, it was really strange because I\u2019d never had sex with him, let alone anyone else. I sent a photo of my coffee mug on the table, but he wouldn\u2019t believe me. We met and he said he and his friends would find me and \u2018stab me in the face\u2019, then he grabbed my hand waving it in the air as we walked shouting for everyone to look at me because I was a \u2018dirty slag\u2019 and a \u2018whore\u2019. Strangely, by the end of that day he\u2019d decided he was in love with me again and we were going to get married etc. etc.!\n\nPeople who are abusive tend to switch very quickly from lovely to vile and back again \u2013 it makes you feel like if you try hard enough you can make them change.\n\nI was so relieved I had talked Shaun down from screaming at me in public that I was happy to accept affection, but as his wild accusations of me having sex show, someone like that will find any excuse to get angry again and there\u2019s really nothing you can do to stop it. One particularly bad day I hadn\u2019t gone to school, I was on the phone sat outside my house because I didn\u2019t want my mum to hear him shouting. He was accusing me of all sorts of sexual affairs which were blatantly not true; he said girls like me deserved to be raped and killed and if I tried to defend myself or just get a word in he\u2019d scream \u2018bullshit\u2019 at the top of his voice over and over again until I shut up. I just snapped and hung up on him and dialled 101 for the non-emergency police. I hadn\u2019t been planning to call the police, it was just a spur of the moment reaction because I felt so trapped and so scared of him I didn\u2019t know what else to do.\n\nTelling the police\nThe police who came round to talk to me were really helpful because they said what Shaun was doing was abuse. I\u2019d never seen it like that before and seeing two officers shake their heads in horror at the way he spoke to me was a powerful message. They made a record of my report but couldn\u2019t take it any further because to fall under harassment you have to tell the person, in writing, that you don\u2019t want contact anymore and then only if they contact you after that can they be arrested. I don\u2019t think this works in general for domestic abuse because when a person has been so abusive already why should one more message turn their behaviour from not-criminal to criminal?\n\nIt\u2019s so hard to avoid contact with someone when you\u2019re used to listening to them and being controlled by them all the time.\n\nI tried to stop talking to Shaun but it didn\u2019t last and then he started using Ask.fm (the anonymous messaging website) to bully me. An Ask.fm account allows anyone to send anonymous messages to you whether they have an account or not. In the months following March 2013 I received thousands of messages most of which I knew were from him.\n\nShaun started making remarks about my little sister who was twelve at the time. We\u2019d been out for my sister\u2019s birthday and I posted a photo of us online; minutes later Shaun was tweeting about how shocking it was one sister could look much more sexy than another, how surprising it was that one person could go from pretty to hideous whilst their younger sister remained gorgeous. He didn\u2019t name us but it was blatant what he was doing.\n\nHe started calling me fat and picking on specific body parts describing how disgusting I looked. He also sent anonymous messages saying things like \u2018you look so sexy now you\u2019re filling out! Keep eating girl!\u2019 He knew I\u2019d never recovered from anorexia and was losing weight since I left hospital so it was just another way to attack me. People say I should have known he just wanted to upset me and ignored it or deleted the Ask.fm account, but I didn\u2019t because I was scared of him. Whatever I did he always found a way to get back in touch and I thought if I didn\u2019t engage with him online it might drive him to confront me in person. He\u2019d described in detail how he fantasised about luring me to his house to then pin me against a wall and rape me before stabbing me to death.\n\nFeeling trapped\nMy self-esteem was already very low and the constant abuse and criticism made it worse. I started self-harming with razor blades copying what Shaun had done and I lost a lot more weight. I think self-harming was a way of outwardly showing what he was doing to me inside. It\u2019s hard to explain how trapped domestic abuse can make you feel; I wanted to die because I couldn\u2019t see any other way to make it stop. On a few especially bad nights the abusive messages just didn\u2019t stop and I picked up kitchen knives saying I was going to kill myself because he\u2019d told me to die. Looking back I find it frightening just how much power he had over me, he wanted me dead and without even coming near me he\u2019d reduced me to hysterics, screaming and sobbing for someone to \u2018make him stop\u2019.\n\nThe final straw that made me go back to the police was at the end of August 2013. I was staying in a hotel alone and Shaun chose that night to send a constant stream of anonymous messages from the afternoon until the early hours of morning. He taunted me for not self-harming \u2018properly enough\u2019, said I should do everyone a favour and slit my throat or drink bleach, the world would be a better place if I was dead and if I wasn\u2019t brave enough to do it someone should stab me that night. A few days later my Ask.fm account was hacked, all the messages were deleted and I received an email to tell me my password had been changed to \u2018I look stupid\u2019. I reported it to Ask.fm numerous times with no response but eventually called the police again.\n\nThe arrest and sentencing\nThe police officers who came around that time weren\u2019t as helpful. I think it\u2019s really important to remember that the way the police respond to domestic abuse is very inconsistent.\n\nIt\u2019s a lottery as to which officers you get, and just because one thinks what you\u2019re reporting isn\u2019t serious or worth looking into it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re right.\n\nThey told me it wasn\u2019t harassment because I\u2019d replied to the messages and they couldn\u2019t do anything because Ask.fm won\u2019t co-operate with the British police. I said I really couldn\u2019t take anymore, I was frightened of him and he was threatening to kill me. They eventually agreed to take a statement from me in the form of a video interview. (If you\u2019re young or have another vulnerability the police will sometimes use a video interview instead of a written statement because it\u2019s easier to express yourself.) The case was handed over to West Midlands, Shaun\u2019s local police force, and around the end of October 2013 he was arrested for harassment \u2013 they had been able to trace the emails about Ask.fm to his IP address.\n\nHe broke his bail conditions and started contacting me. At first it was indirect messages written in his biography section on Twitter. One was written in Russian and when translated read \u201cpoison will kill me before justice is served, you will be sorry I\u2019ll make you suffer\u201d. He had a thing about Russia and said he would abscond there, so writing it in Russian was another way to scare me and he probably knew I was the only person who would bother to translate it. Later he started talking to me on Twitter and Facebook, he threatened to kill himself or me if I didn\u2019t drop the charges and even said he\u2019d get me arrested for harassing him!\n\nIn one of these conversations, Shaun told me he watched child pornography, some of which was stored on the laptop the police had seized. I don\u2019t understand why he told me because he must have known I\u2019d tell the police. He said he only looked at girls who were under sixteen, anyone older he didn\u2019t find attractive. He was nearly twenty then. That changed my perception of him from someone I was responsible for and wanted to help, to a man who really was a danger to young girls. Sometimes it can be easier to help other people rather than yourself so I\u2019d encourage anyone thinking about reporting abuse to the police to remember the likelihood is that the person abusing you will do it to someone else.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t think you deserve help, getting them convicted could help protect other people one day.\n\nIt was incredibly difficult waiting for the police to carry out their investigations but in February 2014 they finally got back to me with a decision. Either they would caution Shaun (which means a formal warning but no conviction) and that would be it over or they would charge him with harassment. They advised me to accept the caution because there was a good chance he would plead not guilty and then I would have to face a trial I was unlikely to win. I asked for the police to charge him because I was frightened nothing would change if he was cautioned.\n\nI was really lucky because he pleaded guilty and in March 2014 I went to court to see him sentenced. The police had told me only to expect him to get a fine because it was his first offence but the judge took it more seriously. Shaun\u2019s solicitor said he should be lenient because it was a \u2018silly mistake\u2019 and Shaun had already lost his job. The judge said it was cruel, calculated abuse and gave Shaun an 18-week suspended prison sentence (this means he\u2019s not actually in prison but if he breaks the conditions of his sentence in the next 2 years it will be \u2018activated\u2019 and he would go to prison), electronic tagging with a curfew for two months, and ordered him to pay me \u00a3250 compensation. He was also given a restraining order that says he can\u2019t contact me via any method or come to the street where I live, anywhere I\u2019m in work or anywhere I\u2019m in education for five years (if he does he\u2019ll go to prison for that). I am so grateful to the judge for taking it so seriously, I know a lot of people don\u2019t get the same result or even a trial and it really does make a difference to me to know that a judge who sentences criminals everyday thought he deserved that sentence.\n\nMy advice\nIt\u2019s really hard to say what would have helped me avoid the situation all together because there were so many things that made me vulnerable and so many times when I wish I\u2019d put a stop to it.\n\nI think the most important thing is just to be aware of all the warning signs of a controlling or abusive relationship.\n\nI had no idea that someone could abuse you without physically hurting you or that it was something that happened so young. Be clear what you think is acceptable in a relationship and stick to it. If you\u2019re concerned or something doesn\u2019t feel quite right, talk about it with a parent, teacher, counsellor, friend\u2026 whoever you trust, and see what they think.\n\nDomestic abuse really can happen to anyone, I was the last person anyone would have seen getting into a relationship like that. It sounds obvious but don\u2019t let any one person or relationship become your whole world. Remember who you were and what you wanted before you met them and keep doing the things you like and seeing other friends. When someone\u2019s controlling you they\u2019ll often get jealous of you seeing friends or family and might try and stop you going to school or work. Shaun knew I had a hard time with my parents and he said as soon as he had money we would live together. When he was angry he said there was no point in me going to school because I was too stupid to learn anything. I said once I wanted to go to university in the future, he suddenly went really off and wouldn\u2019t talk to me for days. Then he said he was furious I\u2019d want to waste my time at university instead of spending it with him! Try and take a step back and think about what you\u2019d think if someone else was in your relationship \u2013 would you be worried for them?\n\nLooking to the future\nI won\u2019t pretend it\u2019s all been easy since he was convicted! Especially to start with I really missed him and felt incredibly guilty that I gave up on him and am the reason he has a criminal record. There are days when I can\u2019t get the things he said to me out of my head and I\u2019m frightened he\u2019ll keep his promises of getting revenge on me one day. Most of all now though, I\u2019m worried he\u2019s going to do the same or worse to someone else. As I grew up he was still interested in twelve and thirteen year old girls and he posts pictures of semi-naked child celebrities all over his Twitter and Facebook. That\u2019s why I went back to the police and reported the sexual activity he pressured me into when I was under 16, I have to feel I\u2019ve done everything in my power to stop him.\n\nThat\u2019s the bad bits though \u2013 trust me, it does get easier after you stop having contact with someone whether it\u2019s because you\u2019re brave enough to leave or after they\u2019re convicted. I threw all my energy into raising awareness of domestic abuse with young people and now all sorts of other feminist and political campaigning too. Learning about gender inequality and violence against women in a wider context helped me see what happened was the result of a sexist society in which many women are oppressed, rather than just entirely my fault.\n\nEven if you think you couldn\u2019t live without someone, please remember you\u2019re good enough on your own and you don\u2019t need them!\n\nIt might take a little while but once you\u2019re free from someone like that you\u2019ll start noticing how much they held you back. I was so determined not to conform to Shaun\u2019s idea of what girls must look like anymore, I got my hair (which was down to my waist in blonde ringlets) cut short!\n\nThinking about the future, I want to finish my A-levels and go to university to study law. Then I want to train as a barrister and work on domestic abuse and women\u2019s rights cases. What I went through with Shaun has opened my eyes to a lot more problems in the world. I don\u2019t think the government does anywhere near enough to protect women from male violence or protect vulnerable people in general. I was angry at Shaun and determined to stop him hurting anyone else, but now I\u2019m angry at the society which made him that way and systems which let men like him get away with it. I\u2019m definitely going to keep campaigning.\n\nIn April 2014, just after Shaun was convicted, I applied for and got funding to start a project to raise awareness of domestic abuse with young people. The Speak Out project launched with an awareness event in July 2014. Since then we\u2019ve done things like help run teacher training about abuse in teen relationships, trained staff at the mental health unit I was an inpatient at and taught lessons on domestic abuse to sixth-formers. I\u2019ve given talks at several different events and conferences as well as becoming a member of the Women\u2019s Aid Young People\u2019s Advisory Panel. Being a part of the Women\u2019s Aid group meant I got to go to the House of Commons and speak to a select committee as part of their inquiry into violence against women and girls. It\u2019s really nice to be able to try and raise awareness and make things better for other young people who\u2019ll go through something similar.\n\nIn terms of future relationships I think Shaun has put me off for a very long time! I want to focus on my A-levels, getting a degree, becoming a barrister, raising awareness of domestic abuse, campaigning for a more equal and just world first, and to be honest that\u2019s quite enough to be getting on with!\n\nWho can help\nThere are loads of organisations and people you can talk to about relationships. After the police investigation started I was referred to Victim Support and met with one of their counsellors for a few months. It would have been better if I\u2019d spoken to people much sooner though. You can talk to someone from Brook if they have a service near to you. There\u2019s also the National Domestic Violence Helpline (0808 2000 247) run by Women\u2019s Aid and Refuge who are specially trained to support people experiencing domestic abuse and they can advise you on how to hide phone calls if someone is checking your phone.\n\nBrook, Women\u2019s Aid and Refuge\u2019s websites all have lots of information about recognizing abuse and asking for help. There is also a really good BBC program called Murdered By My Boyfriend. It\u2019s a real-life story of a girl who was abused and eventually murdered by her boyfriend. I\u2019ve found watching things like that really help because I recognise so many of Shaun\u2019s behaviors in the way Ashley\u2019s (the girl in the program) boyfriend treats her but when you see it happen to someone else it suddenly seems much more serious.\n\nWhen it comes to contacting the police I would say talk to another adult or organisation first and ask them to help you speak to the police. The police should take you seriously but they\u2019re not all perfect. I went back after Shaun was convicted to report the sexual activity I never mentioned in the first investigation. The police officer I spoke to told me he thought I\u2019d \u2018misremembered\u2019 and they tried to convince me there was absolutely no point in investigating Shaun even though he still had pictures of really young teenage girls in tiny clothing all over his Twitter. Over a year later and I am still trying to make complaints against those officers! If you take someone with you to talk to the police they can help you explain the situation and make sure the police treat you fairly.\n\nI think the most important thing to remember when you\u2019re thinking of asking anyone for help is that abuse is never your fault and no one apart from you will think it is. In fact, most people will probably be horrified at how much you\u2019ve suffered already. No one deserves to have their life manipulated and taken away from them, domestic abuse is really serious and everyone deserves to be helped.",
